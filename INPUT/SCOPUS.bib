	abstract = {As an artist-anthropologist who studies “making” through apprenticeship, I have discovered that craft production in the Mexican copper-smithing community of Santa Clara del Cobre is a practice of care, a kind of love. This inversion of careful and caring labor, required to create the well-made copper piece, also encompasses qualities and skills that queer societal stereotypes of binary gender-lines. Artisans generate bodies of knowledge through representative and reproductive performance, i.e. productive labor anchored in the forge through care, perspicacity and attention. Like all nurturing activities given freely, artisanal reproductivity cannot be adequately measured as wage labor. This is not to say that this generous work should be unpaid. But rather to suggest that what is desired of craft is precisely this non-enumerative quotient of care. My research is based upon an apprenticeship to Maestro Jesús Pérez Ornelas, an independent coppersmith artisan, successful enough to be free to follow his vision and imagination, to create things with care. Maestro Jesús would say: “If I counted all the blows of my hammer, I would go crazy! And besides, no client would be able to afford to buy my work!” It is this boundless giftedness that makes up the imaginary of craft, its tropes and aura: its generosity. Like women’s “reproductive” work of family, the work of the artisan is also “reproductive.” Both demand a “maternal” nurturance, unquantifiable attention and care. This quotient of care is pure gift without reciprocity. This non-enumerative labor… a kind of love. © 2023, The Assosiation FormAkademisk. All rights reserved.},

Based on interviews with women from indebted households in Athens and Istanbul, it argues that debt and socially reproductive work come to rely on one another, with gendered implications for caring, expanded agency, and embodied risks. Indebtedness demands forms of socially reproductive labor that women practice through caring for the debt and the indebted family. While this expands women's agency, it also reinforces their experiences of distress and social isolation. This dual outcome reveals gendered contradictions emerging through the interdependency of debt and social reproduction. While the management of debt relies on socially reproductive labor through which women exercise greater agency, it creates embodied risks that threaten their own social reproduction, which also relies on debt.  © 2023 The Author(s).

First, we introduce the feminist critique that calls into question the nationalist and masculinist assumptions that characterise the agenda that conceived welfare regimes as "national worlds." Esping-Andersen's framework highlights the relationships between states and markets, relegating the family (and therefore women) to a subsidiary level in the welfare provision and neglecting the importance of the internationalisation of productive and reproductive work. Then, we present the research agenda on transnational social protection (TSP) that emerged from the necessity to understand the new forms of production and (re)distribution of social protection. Finally, from the perspectives on migration and the gendered nature of the labour markets, the circulation of care and the intersectionality of inequalities, we argue that TSP takes the form of a gendered quest, insofar it is only made possible through the continuous, reflexive and risky (often sacrificial) action of women involved in transnational strategies of social protection. © The Author(s) 2021.

At the same time there are signs of resistance such as transnational mobilizations calling for the universal ban of a practice that is viewed as a form of commodification of women and children. The author introduces the articles included in this monograph issue, which is an original contribution to a sociological understanding of an unprecedented social practice with peculiar characteristics: the presence of a new social actor, the surrogate woman, and the intentional separation of the newborn from the woman he or she identifies as their mother (although they are not genetically related). Because of these characteristics, surrogacy’s impact on the social role and subjective experience of motherhood, its imaginary and narrative, as well as on the status of the child, is not comparable to other forms of assisted procreation and family formation. © The Author(s) 2020.},

The program improved women's aggregate empowerment measures and gender parity in all countries. Reflecting the program's group-based approach, women experienced positive impacts on collective agency indicators in all countries. In Kyrgyzstan, an intervention approach involving both women and men contributed to positive impacts across most indicators.

Using data by the Extended Questionnaire of the Census Sample of the 2010 Population and Housing Census, home-work commuting routes were mapped at the municipal level, combined with four variables of reproductive work.

Based on interviews complemented by institutional documents, I analyse the impact of "multiple languages", "'easy' nationality"and "flexibility for non-family posts"as key requirements for mobile communicators. The institutional shortage of Arabic speakers largely limited their experience to Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) while other communicators allegedly had a broader variety of field experience for career advancement. Linguistic repertoires and nationality shaped mission allocation since acceptance of one's nationality in the host country largely outweighed linguistic competences in Arabic in MENA, with a preference for European or dual nationals and the Lebanese over other Arab nationals. Flexibility for non-family posts, numerous in MENA, seems to reinforce an unequal distribution of reproductive work and structural gender inequalities. Many interviewed women felt that they had to choose between the agency and family. Although desirable, family posts outside MENA were not considered as exciting communications work. Besides hiring L2 speakers with an acceptable nationality, interviewed communicators suggested a new rotation system, advising roles for Arabic-speaking professionals and special quota for women.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

The paper maintains that most homeless people are excluded from the formal sector of the labour market. Therefore, they are engaged in various informal economic activities which help them survive and integrate them in informal support networks. Drawing on neo-Marxist and Honneth’s social recognition theories, the article argues that informal work in which homeless people are involved reduces the ability of employees to control the labour process and their autonomy to the employer. Thus, the informal labour activities further reproduce the precarious social status of the homeless person and perpetuate her social and economic vulnerability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Thereby, the deductive method and bibliographic research were adopted, as well as the information provided by research institutes and published matters related to the pandemic. In this sense, it is necessary to understand the effects of work overload on women and we conclude that the pandemic can be a serious opportunity for reflection on the need for profound changes in social structures, which historically engender and legitimize gender inequalities that mainly affect the lives of women of color, as was made clear in the pandemic context. The study also draws attention to the modality of work called home office, which was adopted exceptionally by some women, due to the need for isolation, but is at serious risk of being used on a large scale after the pandemic. This possibility is an object of concern since it can deepen the destruction of formal jobs and the precariousness of labor rights, in addition to putting mothers and women that are responsible for reproductive work in a situation of greater vulnerability. © 2020, Law and Sexuality Magazine.

In the 1980s, women's work and kin reciprocity helped people access use-values. By 2020, neoliberalism had transformed the national economy and Allpachiqueño migrants overwhelmingly had precarious informal and contract work. Reciprocity and reproductive tasks are still central to livelihood, but now tend to be monetized rather than involving use-values. As that earlier crisis shattered both secure employment and peasant farming to lay the basis for neoliberalism, so now it appears that the COVID-19 pandemic, through the monetization of government support and reciprocity alike, is accelerating financialization in the form of financial services and debt. © 2022 University of Toronto.

	abstract = {Research Framework: This research analyzes rulings of the European Union Court of Justice relating to reproductive work and thus concerning applicants seeking access to specific rights as mothers (biological, intended or potential) or as fathers. Objectives: The aim is to highlight the European laws on reproductive work, i.e., the presuppositions, analogies and deductions on which the Court constructs its reasoning and legal solutions, applicable in social law, and to question their material consequences. Methodology: This research exclusively draws on the European jurisprudence, which is studied from a materialist feminist standpoint. The analysis is firstly discursive, and secondly puts into perspective these discourses with the material consequences of the case law on women’s lives. Results: The Court understands the concept of maternity as a primarily biological reality, because of the physiological vulnerability of pregnant women and young mothers. On the contrary, parental work is perceived as not structurally burdening mothers more than fathers, and the Court applies a gender-blind approach to it based on the equal treatment of men and women. Conclusions: The biologizing analysis of motherhood defended by the Court excludes non-biological mothers, especially those who have resorted to surrogate motherhood (GPA), as well as fathers. Moreover, structural discrimination does not justify the adoption of gender-specific legislation to counterbalance inequalities in the assignment of reproductive work. Contribution: This research shows the ambivalence of European jurisprudence, which oscillates between a regime of exception offering “protection” to pregnant women, and a general regime that minimizes the scope and discriminatory impact of legal and social norms on reproductive work. © 2021 Centre - Urbanisation Culture Societe de l'INRS.

The academic literature on the sexual division of labor does not seem to give due attention to the way in which urban segregation impacts on women’s performance of productive and reproductive work. Combining a bibliographic review and empirical data from recent studies, the central argument is that this process affects women in particular, especially black and peripheral women. It seeks to demonstrate that these women, who as a rule live in the peripheral areas of cities as a result of urban segregation processes, spend much more time in their daily lives to perform both productive and reproductive work, especially because of the displacements they need to make. © 2022,Psicologia Escolar e Educacional.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Cultural Safety as a mode of institutional interruption and accountability seeking has gained momentum in Australia. Developed by Maori nurses as a way of transforming the health impacts of unjust settler colonial systems and practices, it has become institutionalised in health education and practice with a particular emphasis on First Nations people. Despite nursing literature having a rich record in using critical and anticolonial pedagogies there are still barriers to teaching Cultural Safety. In this book chapter, I share my reflections on using arts-based participatory methods to facilitate the teaching of Cultural Safety in an undergraduate nursing program. I begin by setting the scene in settler colonial Australia and talking about how Cultural Safety became incorporated. I consider the barriers to teaching for anti-racism and social justice in the context of utilitarianism, conservatism, and instrumentalism in the neoliberal university. I problematise my own location as a person both outside whiteness and the settler-Indigenous binary but complicit in the colonial project through migration. I reflect on being a minoritised scholar, outside of whiteness attempting to transform whiteness in nursing, in a settler colonial society built on Aboriginal dispossession and carceral logics. I then discuss two case studies where I partnered with First Nations and racialised artists to introduce artistic methods into nursing pedagogy in Victoria, Australia. Where the aim was to assist nurses to integrate a praxis of critical reflexivity. I conclude with my learning from these pedagogical interventions in spaces of white supremacy by questioning the cost for activist scholars of trying to create pockets of healing or reparation. That is undertaking transformative rather than reproductive work in the nursing academy and suggest more collective strategies are needed to create just nursing communities in settler-colonial institutional spaces. My aim in sharing the lessons learned from collaboration with First Nations and Refugee and migrant background artists to implement innovative teaching methods is to amplify these experiences which can assist to activate the transformative potential of nursing education and prepare nursing students for social justice. © Jess Dillard-Wright, Jane Hopkins-Walsh, and Brandon Brown 2023 selection and editorial matter, individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {The restrained state has always sought to devalue socially reproductive work, often consigning it to the private family unit, where it is viewed as a natural part of female relational roles. This marginalisation of social reproduction adversely affects those performing it and reduces their resilience to vulnerability. The pandemic has largely shattered the liberal illusions of autonomous personhood and state restraint. The reality of our universal embodied vulnerability has now become impossible to ignore, and society’s reliance on socially reproductive work has therefore been pushed into public view. However, the pandemic has also exacerbated harms and pressures for those performing paid and unpaid social reproduction, creating a crisis that demands an urgent state response. As it is argued in this paper, the UK response to date has been inadequate, illustrating an unwillingness to abandon familiar principles of liberal individualism. However, the pandemic has also created a climate of exceptionality, which has prompted even the most neoliberal of states to consider measures that in the past would have been dismissed. In this paper, it is imagined how the state can use this opportunity to become more responsive and improve the resilience of social reproduction workers, both inside and outside the home. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {We investigated the perceptions produced about the maternity-work relationship in women working in home office. The sexual division of labor is addressed from the perspective of the debate between productive work and domestic work. In addition, the theoretical conceptions of gender in the home office are analyzed, specifically the maternity-work relationship. The approach is qualitative, and semistructured interviews were conducted with 9 female mothers working from home. Discourse analysis was performed from three categories: sexual division of work, maternity, and home office work. We seek an appropriation related to the meanings of the narratives, indicating different interpretative contexts. Even with greater participation of the spouses, it is established that the recent changes in relation to the sexual division of labor are insufficient, which still faces the hegemony of patriarchy. The results indicate factors that intensify the maternity-work relationship in the context of the home office. A constant overload was identified, resulting from the multiple roles played by them, generating narratives of guilt that come from the feeling of not contemplating satisfactorily neither career nor family. Although the home office is considered a facilitator in the maternity-work articulation, there is an increase in the workload and difficulty in distinguishing leisure time. Although the ideals reinforced for centuries have been undergoing changes, women are expected to be the main responsible for meeting the needs of their children. This is a premise of reproductive work that ends up having adhering in the home office modality. © 2023 UNIVERSIDADE FEEVALEÂ. All rights reserved.},

The article links Freud's own economic and intellectual history to the production of capital and the theft of land and labor in the Caribbean by way of the central European trade in textiles and global cotton production.

This article examines a stark example of domestic workers' exclusion from labour law protection, regulation 57(3) of the National Minimum Wage Regulations, which exempts employers from paying the minimum wage where a worker lives in their employer's family home and is treated 'as a member of the family' in relation to accommodation, meals, tasks and leisure activities. Drawing on feminist theory on the divisions between 'productive' work outside the home versus 'reproductive' work within it, it argues that the exemption's application has reflected gendered devaluation of domestic labour, stemming from its conflation with work normally performed for free by women in the 'private sphere' of the home. Focusing on the December 2020 Employment Tribunal (ET) judgment in Puthenveettil v Alexander & ors, which held that the exemption was unlawful and indirectly discriminatory on the grounds of sex, the article provides timely and in-depth analysis of the prospects for challenging the devaluation of domestic work in light of the limitations of legal protections for domestic workers in the UK. © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This book looks at the dynamic relationship between women's productive and reproductive work in a Global South country from a Global South perspective. Applying a feminist political economy and historical materialist approach and building on an ethnographic extended case study, it analyses the relationships between class and gender across both the productive and reproductive realms at the macro and micro levels in the case of women garment workers in Turkey. Overall, it shows that the material and social conditions of women's productive and reproductive work co-constitute each other. It suggests that productive and social reproductive labour should be examined as an integrated process and an interrelated social relation, in constant dialogue with other social relations. This book is of interest to researchers and students in the disciplines of gender studies, labour studies, feminist economics, sociology and development studies. Given that most studies on social reproduction have largely focused on the Global North, this book is of particular interest to those in search of a more comprehensive and holistic understanding. It is also of great relevance to policymakers concerned with gender and labour issues as well as labour and feminist activists. © 2024 Ayse Arslan. All rights reserved.},

Drawing on qualitative research conducted in the Netherlands, we find that domestic space is remade in small but significant ways in response to bats. The aim of our interviewees is to ensure minimal interference between human and bat domestic geographies: intimacy can be spatialized at the domestic scale but is best done in ways that maintain degrees of tolerance. Rather than help bats in general, much care-work centres around supporting the inter-generational reproductive work of bats.This sequential sense of ethical time certainly shifts conservation from a done to mode, and recasts home-dwellers as participants in the story of bat survival and intergenerational nourishment. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Much of the existing debate on social reproduction focuses on capitalist social relations or is framed around the distinction between the Global North and Global South. Using China, whose unique post-1949 developmental trajectory embraces both elements of socialism and capitalism, this article aims to breakdown the dichotomy between capitalism and other economic systems and instead draw attention to the ways in which households, the state and market are interdependent. Drawing upon an ethnography conducted in two rural villages and three-generational life history data, this article explores how the organization of reproductive work evolved in rural families against the backdrop of wider political and economic transformations since 1949. Through an examination of the inter-linkages between productive and reproductive activities across three generations, it reveals that unpaid reproductive work, performed unambiguously by women, has been central to China's economic modernization in both the Mao and Post-Mao eras. The organization of this reproductive work among women inside the households of each generation since 1949 is influenced by a combination of factors including the patrilocal and patrilineal kinship system, the social welfare context and the economic processes of a particular era. While confirming existing scholarship on migration and agrarian change, by revealing the household as a site of gendered and intergenerational negotiation, this article disputes a linear generational power shift in agrarian transformations. © 2024 The Author.

	abstract = {Critical scholars have started analysing conservation as a ‘mode of production’, which entails conservation's inclination to transform the value of nature into capital. This mode of production is underpinned by labour relations that have thus far escaped systematic analysis. To fill this gap, I use Smiths’ reading of the capitalist production of space to develop the concept of conservation labour geographies which untangles the spatial outcomes of the dialectical relation between the production of conservation space and labour. The concept is concretized through an analysis of the historical development of the private wildlife economy in the Lowveld area of South Africa. Through this case study I argue that private nature reserves subsume communal and state properties -beyond its fence- into exploitative symbiotic conservation labour geographies. I do this by firstly demonstrating that conservation labour geographies are an outcome of the historical production of conservation space because the development of the private wildlife economy in the Lowveld reinforced geographical differentiation by reproducing a spatialized and racialised division of labour. Secondly, I show that these labour geographies are characterised by the unpaid reproductive work of spouses and in-laws, traumatised rangers, and a racially segregated landscapes within the reserve and between the reserves and the former Bantustans. Finally, I conclude by proposing ‘conservation labour geographies’ as an analytical tool to unpack the interrelations between labour and the production of conservation spaces. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Research Framework: Spain ranks first in Europe in the egg “donation” sector. The production and marketing of human oocytes constitute one of the most lucrative markets in the country. Objectives: How do women who offer their eggs understand this donation? In a society where egg “donation” is formally recognized as a voluntary and altruistic act, how do “donors” perceive and consider the remuneration they receive for this practice? Methodology: In-depth interviews were conducted with 38 egg donors from different regions of Spain, including current and past donors, aged between 18 and 49 years. Most interviewees held precarious jobs, were unemployed, and/or were students without scholarships. Results: Egg “donors” did not view their contribution to the human reproductive industry as work, let alone as waged work. Conclusions: Although these women play an essential role in the egg donation process, they are often undervalued. Yet their participation is necessary for the achievement of the family projects of intentional parents. They also contribute to the proper functioning of assisted reproduction clinics and to supplying gamete banks. Contribution: By presenting the social organization of egg donation in Spain, this article sheds light on how the reproductive work carried out by women that produce and give up their eggs is rendered invisible and undervalued. In addition, it gives an account of how biological material is expropriated from egg “donors” – an expropriation that is inadequately compensated and from which they do not benefit. This exploitation of women through the “biomedical mode of reproduction” and the invisibilization of their work is made possible thanks to “donor” anonymity, phenotypic coordination, modes of consent, economic compensation, and, more broadly, the use of the “gift” metaphor and the ideology of altruism. © 2021 Centre - Urbanisation Culture Societe de l'INRS.

In the United States, even though women constitute close to half of the paid labor force, they still perform the lion’s share of unpaid work. The findings indicate that total work time is positively related with emotional distress for women, while there is no statistically significant relationship for men. For women, the relationship between work time and mental health is primarily driven by unpaid work rather than paid work. Evaluating the relationship between mental health and both productive and reproductive work is critical to develop effective public policies toward gender equity and social well-being.

	abstract = {This article gives an overview of how to research work and labour from an anthropological perspective. Based on the examples of my ethnographic research with miners, teachers and digital nomads, I show how the anthropology of work is based both on the dark anthropology of suffering and the dispossessed as well as the anthropology of the good. Anthropology of work, like anthropology in general, is characterised by a holistic approach, cultural relativism and the ethnographic method. I present five points that I have developed in my own research. First, based on the political economy approach, I argue that at the core of the anthropology of work are global inequalities and their everyday expressions at the workplace. I bring examples of my work in an underground mine in Estonia where miners try to regulate and control the tempo of everyday work while the managers try to make them work faster and more, and how such micro-tempo of the everyday is an expression of larger class structures. I also bring an example of the overlap of class and ethnicity among working-class Russian speakers in Estonia. I then discuss how anthropologists also consider the wider political-economic dimension as the industrial accidents in a Kazakhstani coal mine are affected by the global economic situation as well as global inequalities. Secondly, following David Graeber, I argue that work should be studied as producing both material value and immaterial values. I discuss how miners find salary and respect for their job both important and how Estonian teachers produce value in the future labour force and values as the moral base of society simultaneously and feel that they should be given both a decent salary and an immaterial value expressed in their autonomy and professionalism for their work. In neoliberal Estonia, where different values dominate and other professions are more appreciated, they claim to be lacking both. Thirdly, I argue that anthropological research looks at work from a wider perspective than just paid employment and considers also reproductive work. I bring an example of the transformation of women's work in a Kazakhstani coal processing plant where the specialist work of regulating the production process has gradually been taken over by cleaning work akin to domestic reproductive tasks, invisible and unappreciated. Fourthly, I emphasise the embodied nature of work and how it creates intersubjective relations between bodies and inanimate objects such as machines or computer programmes. Finally, anthropology as a discipline that does not take the status quo for granted, is a good tool for questioning the centrality of work and dominance of the Protestant work ethic in the contemporary capitalist world. Based on the example of my work with digital nomads, I discuss how these young professionals knowingly decrease their work hours and are trying to spend their time on other pleasant non-commodified activities. Despite this, it is hard to completely denounce the dominant Protestant work ethic. I conclude by calling for both dark and utopian anthropology of work and more interdisciplinary collaborations. © 2023 Eesti Keele InstituutÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The document proposed here will focus on telework (tt), a form of remote work basically defined by the use of ict and the flexibility of work places and times. Specifically addressing the condition of teleworkers in two sectors that due to the Pandemic are configured as typical sectors, because they are highly teleworkable, and high risk given the close physical contact they entail, these are the commerce and service sectors. The relocation of the tt, that in a Pandemic has been in the homes, stresses the times and traditional forms of work, especially intensifying the occupation times of teleworkers, since they are the ones who preferably assume the care and domestic tasks, translating into the experience of long hours of work due to the concurrence of productive and reproductive work. However, this concurrence does not affect all teleworkers in the same way, but differs according to a series of categories to which they ascribe, particularizing work and life experiences, as well as the reconciliation strategies between work and idleness that they display. The objective of this document is to propose a situated conceptual scaffolding that allows understanding the tensions and diverse and unequal work experiences of women who work in the tt, in the moments of pandemic and projecting scenarios of a post-pandemic future. To do this we used a review of recent literature and seminal references in the social studies of work, paying special attention to the condition of female workers. The methodology basically consisted of a review of the literature and work statistics after a characterization of the current condition of teleworkers. The main contribution is to advance in the definition of useful conceptual notions in the analysis of a female workforce that includes significant heterogeneity. tt in particular would constitute a conceptual challenge, since the approaches used up to now have been applied to precarious jobs and would not admit a heterogeneity of working conditions that are not necessarily or always precarious. © 2023, Revista Colombiana de Sociologia.

Critics of the public goods argument have claimed that it fails because there is no defensible principle that can serve to buttress the claims of parents. Furthermore, these same critics, as well as others, have argued that a certain view of liberal equality militates against sharing the costs of children.This paper challenges both the contention that there is no defensible principle of fairness that can buttress the public goods argument and the contention that liberal equality militates against socialisation. It accomplishes these two tasks together, arguing that the ideal of equality of resources, rather than militating against socialisation, in fact grounds a principle of productive fairness that can serve as the normative premise of the public goods argument for sharing the costs of children. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Second, welfare/immigration analyses are usually set at the national level, but subnational comparisons can challenge tidy welfare state regime categorizations, revealing both nuance and policy opportunities. Third, a focus on social reproduction regimes that includes welfare and immigration policies reveals how jurisdictions border the extraction of social reproductive labour, with impacts on who gets in and under which conditions, and on the distribution of paid and unpaid social reproductive work within immigrant and established families in Canada. Developing our feminist border analysis, we illustrate our approach through a comparative analysis of Quebec and Ontario to show how social reproductive borders extract care labour and from whom, under diverging policy regimes. © The Author(s) 2024.},

But if we examine how care is provided and what care giving demands from professional care workers in these welfare state institutions, the picture looks different. In this thorough, empirical analysis of care and care work in the Danish welfare state we show how important resources for care – emotions and relations – are subject to systematic impoverishment. The Marxist notion of impoverishment serves as an analytical tool that sheds new light on the social sustainability of the Danish welfare state and reveals an unsustainable system that does not allow for professionals to recover emotionally and practice self-care. Instead, the work life of care professionals is full of relations with people in need of a care that is impossible for the care professionals to provide sufficiently. With this analysis, the chapter focuses on the emotional aspects of social sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

This study presents an analysis of the factors that contribute to this migratory process, considering youth and gender variables. The analysis is based on a participatory diagnosis, multisectoral interviews and surveys in thirty-Three communities located in the center of the Ceara State (Northeastern Brazil). The research reveals that the main factor of this migratory process is the lack of appreciation of family farming by the qualified rural youth, who participate little in decision-making. When the analysis of the migration is gender-focused, the invisibility of young women productive and reproductive work stands out as the main driver of migration to urban areas and proves to be greater than for young men. Rural youth migration will shape the rural territory and will probably change the format of family farming. Understanding its factors may help to propose public policies more adapted for family farming.  © L.S. Rabelo.},

The article reconstructs the theoretical shortcomings of such concepts and argues that the shape and power dynamics of GVCs cannot be fully understood without integrating an intersectional perspective on social inequalities, that is the interrelatedness of different dimensions of inequality such as gender, class and race/ethnicity. The article builds on early assumptions of the World System Approach, which point to the entanglement of paid and unpaid, formal and informal work as well as the exploitation of gender, race/ethnicity and (mainly unpaid female) reproductive work. With such perspective, the article aims at analyzing and criticizing concepts of social upgrading in GVCs. A comprehensive understanding of intersectional social inequalities and the underlying power relations as well as an integration of informal and unpaid reproductive work is important for the development of appropriate concepts of economic and social upgrading that do not have adverse effects on women or migrants and improve agency of workers as a whole. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Unlike most mainstream novels and television shows that have helped normalize paid reproductive work, these detective novels, by casting surrogacy as potential crimes, raise urgent ethical and moral questions about the power imbalance between those who commission and those who undertake the labor of marketized reproduction. The novels’ criticism of surrogacy should be seen as part and parcel of a larger critique of domestic and familial ideologies which gives rise to “baby hunger”—a desperation to have genetically related children as the only acceptable basis for family-making. The novels not only draw attention to legal, emotional, and financial consequences of commercial surrogacy, they show how the pursuit of the socially endorsed desire to have “one’s own children” under structurally unequal conditions can lead to violence. Mainstream popular culture represents the contract to deliver particular goods and services (sex, babies, or body parts), too often made under duress of debt and desperation, as “choice.” By contrast, the detective novels by registering “choice” as an ethically murky, even coerced act, allow us to interrogate paid reproductive work in terms of reproductive justice. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

It is based on individual interviews and diary notes collected over three years. Swedish policies encourage mothers as well as fathers to participate in paid labour and to be involved in household and child-care duties. Migrants who have been granted residency as refugees are entitled to extensive social welfare benefits, but they are also required to participate in language studies, accept trainee positions, and actively search for employment. The results of the present study suggest that the refugee fathers come to share daily chores and childcare with their spouse more equally than prior in their home countries. This new fatherhood is referred to in several ways: as a necessity to make family life work; as positive for the father–child relationship; and, as very time- and energy- consuming. Emerging masculinities and caring masculinities evolve in the analyses, and the results show comprehensive fathering, that is, fatherhood characterized by care, intimacy and love that are the result of hard, straining (reproductive) work that takes place with limited financial and/or cultural resources. © 2020 The Author(s).

The exploitation of women’s unpaid and low-paid reproductive work has persisted throughout various stages of capitalist development. Migrant domestic workers’ underpaid reproductive labor becomes an essential site for primitive capital accumulation and the production of the labor force in the contemporary neoliberal global economy. Building upon analyses of the historical and contemporary circumstances of transnational migrant domestic workers in Canada, I argue that digital labor platforms become a technology-enabled, capital-driven force in the larger commodification and exploitation process of migrant workers’ reproductive labor, and such processes are underpinned by entangled structural and institutional forces of the uneven capitalist development, racism, patriarchy, and the state’s discriminatory (im)migration and labor policies. The article suggests that understanding the seeming prevalence of platform work should be situated in the continuous formal subsumption of reproductive labor and the class immobility of migrant domestic workers, and labor activism and movements should contest the entwined power dominations beyond merely demanding regulations over platforms. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {The debate about care has intensified in the COVID-19 crisis. A consensus appears to be emerging that care work—mostly provided by women—is not only essential to our societies, but also undervalued, reputationally as well as—for the paid work—regarding its remuneration. As care is essential for the cohesion of societies, there is an urgent need to improve the situation. However, care comes in too many forms for general recommendations for improving the situation to be effective. Its majority in terms of working hours is unpaid, but the paid part of it in health, caring or education, is indispensable for any society built upon a division of labor. Finally, not every activity is work, and not every work is care—thus leisure activities are not necessarily care work. Care can be motivated by a plethora of reasons, and take a diversity of forms. To allow for effective suggestions for improvement to be formulated, we deem it necessary to more systematically distinguish different classes of care (each class of course being an ideal type including a wide range of activities). We suggest doing so by first using the “potential third party” criterion to distinguish work and non-work activities, secondly classify work according to the beneficiaries (which is closely linked to but not the same as organizational characteristics), and thirdly characterize the specific role of care work in these categories. The beneficiaries also reflect the motivation held by agents why care work is undertaken, although rarely any motivation comes in isolation. Starting from the proximate causes, the first class of care is caring for oneself, be it in terms of health care, hygiene, or the self-production of consumer goods, both short and long lived. The second class we suggest is caring for the family (native and chosen family including friends). It again includes caring for their health, but also their household (either the common one, or the one the caretaker is managing for the care receiver). It often includes nursing the elderly, disabled or young children, but can also be a kind of neighborhood support, from joint gardening to mutual help in building or renovating a flat or house. Extending the reach of care even wider, we come to care for the public good, with the community from village or city district to higher levels being the beneficiaries. This includes the volunteers working with environment, development, feminist, trade unions, food banks or belief organizations. Finally, there is a whole range of professional care activities, with the possibility to take over any of the previously mentioned activities if there is a financial benefit to be expected, or one is offered by (government) subsidies. We observe a permanent process of substituting professional, exchange value oriented care work for voluntary, use value based care, and vice versa. This dynamic, in combination with the ongoing changes of technology, social security systems and work organization in the remunerated work sets the framework conditions which will determine the future of care, commercial and societal. However, such trends are no destiny; they can be shaped by political interventions. Whether or not a professional or voluntary approach is preferable, depends on the assessment criteria applied which in turn represent political, ethical and cultural preferences.

	abstract = {Migration and environmental change are deeply interconnected processes, intimately linked to development pathways. The gender dimension of these complex interactions is often overlooked. Yet there are profound linkages and implications. This paper focuses on the gender division of labour to investigate how migration and environmental change relate to gender equality and sustainability. The study draws on research conducted in the Mahanadi delta, in the eastern Indian state of Odisha. In the Mahanadi delta labour migration is largely male dominated. Women remain behind in vulnerable environments facing social and economic challenges having impacts on their empowerment and wellbeing. The findings show shifts in work burden, as women often engage in new activities alongside the traditional domestic and social reproductive work but highlight differences across age and household headship. Firstly, this paper identifies the connections between gender, sustainability and care –conceptually and empirically. Secondly, it explores the gender division of labour in the study area by discussing its structural causes. Thirdly, it provides insights into migration dynamics and examines how they feed back into gender equality and sustainability. Finally, it argues for the need of integrated analytical approaches that reflect ecological and social-equity challenges. © 2021 The Authors},

Special attention will be given to the relationship between the realms of production and those of reproduction. The goal of this reading is to establish the most important variations between the two, underlining the differences and similarities between the diverse conceptual approaches in use. Using the analogy of the “purple glasses”, three different approaches are identified: (i) with single vision lenses (looking at either production or reproduction), which attempts to describe the two realms from the viewpoint of only one of the two, (ii) with bifocal lenses, which consider productive and reproductive work as equally relevant, while establishing clear-cut differences between the two, and (iii) with progressive lenses, which allow us to see the two domains as part of a continuum, stressing their simultaneities, overlays and intermittencies. Taking into account the proliferation of studies espousing a gender perspective -and without denying their peculiar contributions-, the approach attempted here tries to determine how each “lens” is useful in efforts to grasp the particular patterning of each kind of work and to supplement such analysis by taking into account specific times and places. © 2021 Zibeline International Publishing Sdn.

In the narrative, I examine what point the literary household children reveal about those bodies that are excluded from the right to a childhood in Brazil. I intend to investigate the hypothesis that, in the late nineteenth century, the representation of household children in Brazilian literature discloses a space for the formation and reproduction of literary techniques that rearrange themselves from a white-western perspective. In other words, I try to relate this figure to the characterization and configuration of family frameworks that are always subsumed under the European perspective on the organization of families of the enslaved, according to Robert Slenes' Na senzala, uma flor. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the works under the configuration of reproductive work in Brazil to compose the relation of reproduction of the workforce in the end of slavery in the periphery of capitalism, especially in what it refers to the crossover between race, class, and gender in the country. © 2022 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

Suk shows that misogyny lies not in animus but in the overempowerment of men and the overentitlement of society to women's unpaid labor and undervalued contributions. This is a book about misogyny without misogynists. From antidiscrimination law to abortion bans, the law fails women by keeping society's dependence on women's sacrifices invisible. Via a tour of constitutional change around the world, After Misogyny shows how to remake constitutional democracy. Women across the globe are going beyond the antidiscrimination paradigm of American legal feminism and fundamentally resetting baseline norms and entitlements. That process, what Suk calls a "constitutionalism of care," builds the public infrastructure that women's reproductive work has long made possible for free. © 2023 by Julie C. Suk.

In this article I discuss how this input is being rendered invisible or at least underappreciated by sexist, racist, and classist practices of othering. To illustrate the point, I will use examples from two empirical research projects that looked into how families in Germany outsource various forms of reproductive work to both female and male migrants from Eastern Europe. Drawing on the concept of othering developed in feminist and postcolonial literature and their ideas of how privileges and disadvantages are interconnected, I will put this example into the context of literature on racism, gender, and care work migration. I show how migrant workers fail to live up to the normative standards of work, family life, and gender relations and norms set by a sedentary society. A complex interaction of supposedly “natural” and “objective” differences between “us” and “them” are at work to justify everyday discrimination against migrants and their institutional exclusion. These processes are also reflected in current political and public debates on the commodification and transnationalisation of care. © 2022 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Between 1965 and 1980, disposable diapers became the norm among middle-class American families, altering resource flows as they became more popular. Diapers crafted from wood and water of the United States, primarily from the South - rather than that region's cotton - covered infant bottoms. The turn to single-use diapers also transformed knowledge production. For the first half of the twentieth century, women had carried out the interrelated tasks of making diapers, caring for children, and laundering diapers. This work informed women's understandings of children's bodies and the material world. By the 1950s, pre-folded diapers and home washing machines simplified the acts of diaper creation and maintenance and associated this work ever more strongly with the household. In the 1970s, economic pressures and feminism prompted families to rethink the way they cared for infants' wastes as disposable diapers simplified household work, and shifting cultural norms encouraged their adoption. Thus, families embraced them. The work of maintaining diapers was replaced with the work of disposal. This history of the disposable diaper centers on reproductive work, tracing the tasks inherent in diapering as well as the shifting social norms and codes that legitimized disposable diapers. Ultimately, the disposable diaper not only offers lessons about the costs of a disposable society but also new insights about changing dynamics of family life and their impact on the environment in the 1970s. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Scholarship on gendered impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on academia has denounced how academic mothers’ research and teaching performance have been disproportionately disrupted compared to those of their male colleagues, given the generally unequal division of reproductive work. Gendered notions of motherhood remain central to conceptions of what women are, and motherhood is regularly portrayed as the main hindrance to academic women’s careers. However, little is known about the experiences of childfree women academics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on in-depth interviews with childfree women in academia about how they navigated the transformations brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper argues that the perception of childfree women as the ideal worker and a gendered conceptualization of work-life balance have rendered childfree academic women’s hardships invisible. This article concludes that, contrary to the idea that childfree women academics were unencumbered during the COVID-19 pandemic, these women faced various struggles that significantly affected their emotional well-being and availability for work. The evidence underlines the importance of studying childfree women academics to disentangle the complexity of women’s experiences in neoliberal academia. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

To this end, we retrieved and compared empirical data from two qualitative research works conducted between 2012 and 2018 with female goat producers and female migrant farm workers, which allowed us to find singularities in every case, as well as common aspects in their reproductive labors. In order to provide empirical evidence to contribute to the feminist and/ or gender debate regarding care and domestic work, this writing is structured by sections; the first one describes basic methodological characteristics of reference studies; the second one recovers antecedents on reproductive work in rural areas of Latin America; the third one refers to some aspects of Mendoza agricultural context and then focuses on the cases, particularly on describing and reflecting on the reproductive labor experiences of both women groups studied. Finally, the conclusions seek to highlight the singularities that reproductive labor acquires in rural contexts, the porosity of its boundaries with productive activities, the simultaneity of these burden activities in the daily life of female workers, and the dynamism of said labors associated with agricultural production seasonality and cycles of nature. © 2021, Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Catholic University of Temuco.

	abstract = {The article ties in with the scholarship on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on gender equality. Based on a qualitative analysis of interviews with parents of children under 12, we examine the processes that led to the increase or dismantling of the gender division of labour in families during the first nationwide lockdown. Using the concepts of path dependency and ‘doing’ and ‘undoing’ gender, we explain the strategies couples with children used to adapt to the enormous increase in reproductive work in the family during lockdown. ‘Doing gender’ practices witnessed during lockdown included an acceptance of the increased care work as the responsibility of women, ensuring ‘a room of one’s own’ only for men, and separating the public and private sphere only for men. Practices that led to ‘undoing gender’ involved mainly the explicit negotiation between partners of the division of labour during the lockdown and the organisation of reproductive work in ‘shifts’. The division of labour within a couple before the pandemic proved to be crucial for what strategy they chose to adapt to the lockdown. According to our findings, extending the egalitarian division of labour has led to greater satisfaction among partners and indicates greater societal resilience to crises. © 2022 Sociologicky Ustav.

	abstract = {The future of work has become a pressing matter of concern: Researchers, business consultancies, and industrial companies are intensively studying how new work models could be best implemented to increase workplace flexibility and creativity. In particular, the agile model has become one of the “must-have” elements for re-organizing work practices, especially for technology development work. However, the implementation of agile work often comes together with strong presumptions: it is regarded as an inevitable tool that can be universally integrated into different workplaces while having the same outcome of flexibility, transparency, and flattened hierarchies everywhere. This paper challenges such essentializing assumptions by turning agile work into a “matter of care.” We argue that care work occurs in contexts other than feminized reproductive work, namely, technology development. Drawing on concepts from feminist Science and Technology Studies and ethnographic research at agile technology development workplaces in Germany and Kenya, we examine what work it takes to actually keep up with the imperative of agile work. The analysis brings the often invisibilized care practices of human and nonhuman actors to the fore that are necessary to enact and stabilize the agile promises of flexibilization, co-working, and rapid prototyping. Revealing the caring sociotechnical relationships that are vital for working agile, we discuss the emergence of power asymmetries characterized by hierarchies of skills that are differently acknowledged in the daily work of technology development. The paper ends by speculating on the emancipatory potential of a care perspective, by which we seek to inspire careful Emancipatory Technology Studies. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The experiences of older migrants remain under-researched but the way they journey between sending/receiving societal contexts is deserving of academic and policy attention. We focus on older migrants from the Mainland China (henceforth PRC grandparenting migrants) who move temporarily to Singapore and Australia to provide care for grandchildren. In both countries the productive labour of the young Chinese migrants needs to be sustained through reproductive work. As such, thousands of Chinese grandparents embarked on transnational journeys to Singapore or Australia to provide care for their grandchildren. The two countries also adopt a “managed migration” approach that stratifies migrants by their desirability and restricts family reunification, making it challenging for grandparenting migrants to qualify for long term residency to remain with their children abroad. We carried out in-depth interviews with 72 grandparenting migrants in Singapore (41) and Sydney (31). Our chapter provides a comparative analysis of how PRC grandparenting migrants adjust to life and care work in a foreign country, as well as how they envision their ageing futures in a trans-territorial context. The focus that we bring to older adult migrants who move for grandparenting duties in the reproductive sphere addresses an important gap in extant analyses of middling transnationalism, which has focused mainly on younger migrants who engage in paid work. Our chapter further considers the transnational social fields that PRC grandparenting migrants inhabit, and the lifecourse implications of personal migration and their children’s migration on how they strategise for old age back in China or in a foreign country. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Shanthi Robertson and Rosie Roberts; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {The exhaustion faced by academics served as the starting point for this special issue – edited, written, and reviewed exclusively by cis and trans women. We understand exhaustion as a consequence of historical and daily battles for gender equality, aggravated by the burden of reproductive work. Thus, even when exhausted, we accepted this challenge out of the conviction of the political role necessary to open spaces in the face of a masculine logic of science production. This editorial was structured based on recognizing the importance of producing, identifying, and living with the challenges necessary to disrupt oppression. These challenges come in the form of (1) bringing together female editors, authors, and reviewers from different regions, academic backgrounds, and diverse representations; (2) time, which revealed itself as an instrument of domination and gender violence; (3) the operationalization of the contradiction in producing an edition exclusively for women, considering the male logic of practicing science. This edition should be read as a pedagogical instrument to visualize the challenges experienced, and it is a call for collective responsibility in the fight to create space in everyday life, specifically in the academic field. Finally, if we are to combat injustices, we must provoke daily discomfort, and this edition set out to do just that. © 2023, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Using an intersectional approach in qualitative research, we examine how parents coped with the increased demands of childcare and how their perception of childcare changed during the pandemic. More generally, we ask whether the pandemic situation was an opportunity for greater recognition and valuation of care. We present an analysis of serial qualitative interviews with 32 solo mothers and 19 parents living in couples that were conducted between the spring of 2020 and the summer of 2021. Parents had a both positive and negative experience of care during the Covid-19 pandemic. The first school closure in the spring of 2020 was perceived as a rather positive opportunity to step outside the course of everyday life. However, as the pandemic continued, the long-term negative effects that the increased care duties during lockdown had on people and especially mothers became apparent: a worsening labour market position, a deteriorating economic situation, and an increasing dependence of women on male breadwinners or on the social support system. The pandemic highlighted the paradox of reproductive work in late capitalism and showed how childcare has no market value in itself. Although in the first period of the pandemic parents experienced care to some extent as an opportunity, a source of meaning, and a rediscovered value, overall the pandemic did not lead to a greater recognition or valuation of care in society. © 2022 Sociologicky Ustav.

Amid a global crisis of social reproduction exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is pressing to ask: What tools are available to imagine a production of space that is effectively feminist, anti-racist, and decolonial? Drawing from proposals from Latin American feminist authors, I discuss how the combination of patriarchy, capitalism, and colonialism has shaped social reproduction and modes of resistance. To do so, I reflect on the experience of a group of women living and working together in an ocupação in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The analysis uses data from research carried out in 2018, involving interviews, informal conversations, and participant observation. These women’s experiences allow us to understand how these practices create theory that relates to their reality. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Introduction. The problem of the development of reflexive abilities in the process of professional training of a teacher is relevant in view of the formation of the student's subjective position as one of the significant results of learning at a university. Of particular research interest is the study of the influence of the development of professional intelligence on the reflective abilities of students - future elementary school teachers. The purpose of the article is to assess the impact of the process of vocational training on the development of reflective and cognitive abilities of students - future primary school teachers. Materials and methods. The sample of the study consisted of 104 students of the Pedagogical University studying in the field of "Primary Education". Reflective abilities were assessed by the test of reflection of V.D. Shadrikov, S.S. Kurginyan. Intellectual abilities were measured using R. Amthauer intelligence structure test. The data were analyzed by methods of primary descriptive statistics, non-parametric U-Mann-Whitney comparison test, linear and rank correlation methods of r-Pearson and r-Spearman. The results of the study. The partial nature of the development of the parameters of reflection of activity has been established, which is manifested in the fact that different tasks of vocational training require the intensification of individual reflexive abilities. The beginning of vocational training (1st year) is associated with a more intense reflection of motivation and goal setting, which is explained by the need to correlate expectations with the real conditions of study at a university; inclusion in a long and intensive pedagogical practice (3rd year) actualizes the reflection of the subject and subjective conditions of activity, as well as ways to solve pedagogical situations. A contradiction was found between the growth in the level of intellectual abilities during the learning process and the decrease in the reflection of educational and professional activities - about 80% of significant correlations between the parameters of intelligence and reflection are negative. This indicates both the specifics of the professional training of a primary school teacher and the need to reduce the volume of reproductive work in the process of educational and professional activities. Conclusion. The results of the study are of great practical importance for organizing and improving the process of professional training of students - future primary school teachers. The strategy for the formation of reflexive abilities should be non-linear, taking into account not only the individual characteristics of the student, but also the specifics of the tasks solved at different stages of professional training. © 2022 LLC Ecological Help.

We offer a critical analysis of the boundaries of formal and informal, paid and unpaid, productive and reproductive work, and explore how austerity policies implemented in Greece in the aftermath of the global financial crisis have transformed women’s everyday lives. In contributing to critical discussions of neoliberal capitalism and recent feminist geography studies, our empirical study focuses on how women’s struggles over social reproduction unfold in the public and private spheres. It proposes that women’s temporary retreat to unpaid work at home constitutes a form of resistance to intensifying precarisation, and, at times, contributes to the emergence of new collective forms of reproduction. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Objective: this article analyzed how women who own a clothing business in the Agreste region of Pernambuco (re)organized their productive and reproductive work in the private space of their homes, taking into account gender relations. Theoretical framework: it is based on the discussion about the sexual division of labor, the dynamics of conciliation between public and private spaces, the triple shift, and the insertion of women in the labor market, based on the problems they face. Method: a qualitative descriptive approach was used, with 23 semi-structured interviews. Results: findings point out that having their own business at home generates a false impression of flexibility for women; the owners’ work routine is exhaustive and with the accumulation of productive and reproductive activity intertwined in the same space, generating triple shifts and precarious working conditions; the financial emancipation of women who work in clothing occurs from the (re)organization of their functions in the private environment of the home, diverging from the literature that relates their autonomy to entering the public environment of the labor market; and informality, typical of the region, favors the entry of the interviewees into the clothing sector, but deprives them of access to social security. Conclusion: the theoretical contributions reveal that women do not necessarily need to leave the private space to enter the productive work world and achieve a certain emancipation, as they manage to do this from the (re)organization of productive work in the home environment itself. © 2023, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

These processes have been expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and attention is drawn to the technology-driven organisational and operational innovations that are transforming academic divisions of labour and labour processes. These changes, particularly in relation to the separation of research and teaching, and to the deprofessionalisation, modularisation, and outsourcing of the latter, are the focus of the paper. We argue that the formal subsumption of knowledge production (research) through commercialisation dovetails with a real subsumption of socially reproductive work (teaching) that is undergoing qualitative transformation in an increasingly marketised higher education sector. We show how digitalisation actively contributes to the growing standardisation and flexibilisation of work, deepens long-standing gendered divisions of labour, and dissolves even further the blurred work/life boundaries for precariously employed workers. These new hallmarks of the contemporary subsumption present new challenges to workers and their collective organisations in Higher Education. © 2022 The Authors.

The data reveal the complex ways in which the ethics of care and of justice interlock in the children's discourses. The article concludes by tracing the links between these results and the conditions of productive and reproductive work in contemporary Chile as reflected in the children's discourses, and it shows how children have begun to internalise a focus on children's rights in reflecting on their daily lives. © 2024 National Children's Bureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

From early discussions about “who counts as an essential worker” to post-pandemic arguments about what constitutes the “infrastructure” needed to rebuild the economy, the pandemic led to reexaminations of the kinds of investments and activities necessary for the continuity of our social system. This article examines these debates through the lens of the labor theory of value as expanded by feminists and ecologists. Drawing on my 2017 book, The Politics of Value, I discuss how the political-economic upheaval that the pandemic unleashed laid bare the essential nature of care and social reproductive work, low-wage labor, public sector provisioning, and ecosystem services. The stark dilemmas of holding body and soul together during the crisis created an opportunity to rethink the artificial lines between the market and the rest of life, highlighting the essential nature of activities formerly unrecognized or considered nonproductive. The article discusses how we might take advantage of this opening to create new vocabularies and measurement practices that take into “account” and fairly reward formerly invisible and unvalued forms of labor. © 2023 The Author.

The methodology was designed based on the qualitative analysis of 10 interviews of women workers between 59 and 74 years of age who have grown old as seasonal workers. The results show that the concept of precarious emancipation would crystallize in access to economic autonomy, but at the cost of sacrificial work rhythms in tension with reproductive labour.

	abstract = {Objective: in this essay, we analyze the roots of the exhaustion of Brazilian working women from the point of view of the dialectical historical materialism method. We investigate the exhaustion in terms of physical, emotional, and mental fatigue of Brazilian working women by using the concepts of social reproduction and dependent capitalism to reveal that women’s overtiredness is not a novelty inaugurated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Thesis: even before this global health crisis, the overload of work, inside and outside the domestic space, was already a reality for Brazilian women. We suggest that super-exploitation, essential to dependent capitalism, implies a growing intensification of the working time of Brazilian women workers, at the same time that dependence relegates them to the task of internal and external social reproduction in globalized capitalism. Conclusions: the rupture with these processes demands the radical transformation of the current social order and economic system, for which the political organization to demand payment from the state for reproductive work is an important step in the social battle against the depletion of women. © 2023, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Thereby, I reexamine what traditionally is termed as the aesthetics of production. An aesthetics of production is, I suggest, not about natural talent and originality of the soloist artist genius but is founded on the interdependency of life and work, and what enables the artist to do work. Feigl and Gautadóttir's performances include what has been excluded as disturbances by idealist aesthetics of production: the sociality, temporality and economy of the artistic work. By proposing a feminist-materialist aesthetics of production, I claim that the artist's work is not only working by the numbers of the present production conditions, but is also performing and intervening within the infrastructures of art. © 2022 Institute of Aesthetic Studies.

My research on commercial surrogacy in Georgia offers an interesting case study to reassess the relevance of Marxist research frameworks, as it uncomfortably disrupts capitalist dualisms of production versus reproduction, family versus market, gift versus commodity and waged versus unwaged work. Today, Georgian surrogates are paid for putting their reproductive biologies and gestational bodies to work in the (re)production of babies, family happiness and surplus value in the surrogacy industry. Yet, neither in classic political economy accounts nor in its Marxist counterpart are they seen as 'real' workers. On the contrary, surrogates and their 'labour of love' are made invisible and relegated to the hidden abodes of reproduction. In this chapter I use the work of Marx and his disobedient feminist 'granddaughters' to analyse and politically translate the invisibility of reproductive work in the global surrogacy industry. © 2021 Alessandra Mezzadri editorial matter and selection.

Scholars have illustrated the many ways that social reproduction is reconfigured through transnational labour migration, and troubled the categorisation of economically productive and socially reproductive labour. Expanding on their work, I engage with scholarship about Indigenous communal governance in Guatemala and Mexico, particularly the theories of Gladys Tzul Tzul on reproduction, in order to present new insights into feminist geographical knowledge of diverse economies and social reproduction. Drawing on ethnographic methods, I present three empirical examples, which illustrate how the intermingling of economic production and reproduction of communal life make Indigenous futures. I argue that large-scale reproductive activities, such as those deployed by the community, produce values beyond capitalist circuits of production and that it is how remittances are inserted into the local communal economies that render the money valuable for reproducing life and securing a future.

Under the Justice and Development Party (AKP) governments, Turkey has been a prime example of these patterns of accumulation and dispossession. Additionally, the country has been facing coal rush policies of the AKP governments with the aim of utilizing domestic coal to overcome the problem of energy supply security. In this paper, I argue that rural change and patterns of proletarianization in the rural extractive regions are inherently gendered and women assume a central role in the production and social reproduction of the classes of extractive labour. Drawing on 3-year research conducted in the Soma Coal Basin, Western Anatolia, Turkey, the paper examines the transformation of women's (i) petty commodity production as unpaid family farmers, (ii) agricultural wage work and (iii) reproductive work as miners' wives and subsistence farmers as a result of rising private sector coal investments since the mid-2000s. © 2023 The Authors.

Through a qualitative study of commercial surrogacy in north India, it examines the lived experiences of surrogates within the capitalist social relations they are embedded in. Conceptualising surrogacy as reproductive labour which contributes to value generation, the article assesses labour relations at the workplace, for example hostels where surrogates ‘live and work’, and the mechanisms of recruitment, contracting and control which function through dense networks of social and material relations between various stakeholders. The weak bargaining power of surrogates and the immense power of fertility clinics and agents are compounded by the lack of effective regulation and the state’s prohibitionist policy.

Different forms of labor support the transnational fertility market, bringing geopolitical, and social inequities to the fore. While some people need wombs, eggs, or sperm to create their families—and have the means to pay for third-party reproductive services—others emerge as suppliers of reproductive labor, and still others as coordinators or service agents in the international fertility industry. Building upon contemporary feminist social science and postcolonial research on reproductive travel and labor, this article explores three intersecting components: the forces that influence reproductive travel and cross-border egg donation; how emotion and meaning are framed in clinical settings to recruit a young, healthy, able-bodied workforce; and the embodied experiences of women who travel across borders to provide eggs for pay. Drawing upon donor and professional interviews, and multisited online and ethnographic fieldwork in fertility clinics, we explore the linkages between emotional choreography and the creation of a bioavailable workforce for the global fertility trade. Here, we examine how local and cross-border egg provision illuminate global reproductive hierarchies—what we call “reproductive colonialism”—in transnational reproduction. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study examines how large-scale environmental shocks alter the gender division of labor in traditional rural societies. Using individual-level time allocation data from the Pakistan Rural Household Panel Survey 2012, 2013, and 2014, I compare hours spent per week across productive and reproductive activities of more than 8000 adult men and women after the 2011, 2012, and 2013 floods in 76 villages from three provinces of Pakistan. Individual-level panel data is combined with village-level flood inundation depth data collected using remotely sensed (MODIS) satellite imagery. The panel fixed-effects regression results reveal a significant shift in the gender division of labor for both paid and unpaid work in the flood-affected villages. For a 1-m flood inundation depth, men's and women's weekly time use as hired labor increased by ~2 and ~1 h, respectively, women's weekly time allocation on child and elderly care decreased by ~1.5 h, and men's weekly labor allocation for reproductive work and fuel collection increased by ~2 h. Overall, a 1-m inundation depth increased the weekly time allocation for all activities for men by ~6 h and women by ~2 h. Women's time allocation changes were most pronounced for landless and marginal agricultural landowners (<0.5 ha), when compared with medium and large landowners. The favorable shift in the gender division of reproductive work was positively associated with women's decision-making power. Men who believed that both men and women should equally participate in income generation activities were more likely to increase their reproductive work time. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research focuses on the extent sharing economy transforms employability for women impacted by domestic and reproductive work. The authors explore the experience of mothers, of how digital peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms can affect their self-perceived employability and skills deterioration by unlocking human capital through technology acceptance. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a pragmatism-based approach incorporating using a single-case study research design with the Gioia methodology. It utilised a semi-structured telephone survey to collect data to explore the decisions around usage of a newly developed mobile P2P app, aiming to support employability among mothers. Analysis was conducted inductively using thematic analysis and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The study finds that mothers experience high rates of continued labour market attachment on a casual or part-time basis, difficulty in juggling family and work, and high levels of concern both about future employment/entrepreneurial opportunities and expected stress in balancing dual roles of carer and earner. While mothers are interested in using new sharing economy technologies to reduce skills deterioration and improve signalling, the authors find that there were both technology and non-technology related barriers. These included trust and security, life-stage mismatch, time poverty and limitation of service offerings. Research limitations/implications: This research was limited to mothers in one state in Australia and by the case study research design, the measurement model and the self-report nature of the data collection. Hence, the findings may lack generalisability in other contexts. It also limits the ability to make conclusions regarding causality. Originality/value: This exploratory study contributes to research in the intersection between human resources (HR) and entrepreneurship by illustrating how sharing economy platforms can offer women a means to overcome the issues of signalling and skills deterioration in relation to aspects of human capital theory by developing new skills that may act as positive signals signal to potential employers or investors. Additionally, the social interactions between mothers, through technology adoption, can provide a basis for improving future self-employment or entrepreneurship and employability. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This article focuses on the socialist socio-historical context to explore the social reproduction performed by lower working-class women in Shanghai during the COVID-19 outbreaks. To probe the pandemic interruptions to social reproduction, a COVID-19 Diary-Writing Workshop was conducted in 2020 to collect diaries written by destitute and disadvantaged women (pinkun funü) living in the Workers’ New Villages. By delving into the women’s affective lives, the article shows that women not only contributed to community through their volunteerism in social reproductive labour but also sacrificed for their families in a time of crisis. Moreover, women endured mental stress as the main performers of social reproductive work, and communal services provided by neighbourhood committees helped relieve the stress of household chores and resolved tensions related to food shortage. Our findings confirm scholars’ longstanding argument that communal support policies can alleviate the gendered exploitative nature of social reproductive labour, and shed light on the roles of the remaining structures of socialist communal organization and infrastructure. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This extends beyond dealing with the physical side effects of contraception and can include the emotional burden of planning conception and the financial cost of accessing health services. This scoping review aimed to map how reproductive responsibilities were defined and negotiated (if at all) between heterosexual casual and long-term partners during any reproductive life event. Original research in high-income countries published from 2015 onwards was sourced from Medline (Ovid), CINAHL and Scopus. In studies that focused on pregnancy prevention and abortion decision making, men felt conflict in their desire to be actively engaged while not wanting to impede their partner’s agency and bodily autonomy. Studies identified multiple barriers to engaging in reproductive work including the lack of acceptable male-controlled contraception, poor sexual health knowledge, financial constraints, and the feminisation of family planning services. Traditional gender roles further shaped men’s involvement in both pregnancy prevention and conception work. Despite this, studies reveal nuanced ways of sharing responsibilities–such as companionship during birth and abortion, ensuring contraception is used correctly during intercourse, and sharing the costs of reproductive health care. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

It is also approached an identification of relationship possibilities between each model. The theory of care is proposed as the methodology that prevails in the management of the commons since it entails a vindication of reproductive work. Based on the study of several projects, this article establishes a classification of two types of intersection between contemporary artistic practice and common spaces. Dividing the artistic projects that are constituted as commons, from the common spaces that offer an infrastructure for creation. The relationship that these projects maintain with the public system is also analysed, from non-interaction relationship to a subsidy of resources.

Based on an original theoretical framework that combines a Thompsonian historical materialist class approach, a Marxist-feminist social reproduction approach and a feminist political economy approach to the everyday, this article suggests that productive and reproductive work should be analysed as an integrated process and everyday experience of social life, and in relation to each other. This argument is then applied to the case of Turkey to indicate the interplays between the productive and reproductive realms at the national political economy level and the significant role of the state in shaping the reciprocal relationships of production and reproduction. Building on an ethnographic extended case study of women garment workers carried out over 14 months, it then analyses the interrelatedness of production and reproduction at the everyday level, within women’s daily experiences and from their own perspectives. Overall, the article argues that the relations and socio-material conditions of production and reproduction are constitutive of each other at the macro and micro political-economic levels and should be analysed from a comprehensive, relational approach in their historical and geographical context and in dialogue with the everyday. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

It suggests that while SRT productively addresses longstanding debates within Marxist feminism, it has yet to adequately theorize the shifting spatialities of reproductive work and the relationship between social reproduction and the state. To address this relative weakness, this article stages a dialogue between SRT and the emergent neo-Lefebvrian literature on state space and the multiscalar geographies of capitalist urbanization. The primary claim at stake in this context is that reproductive work is periodically and systematically reorganized and re-spatialized in relation to the broader crisis dynamics of capital, and the reweaving of the urban fabric; and, moreover, that this process of reorganization and re-spatialization is profoundly mediated, managed, and canalized by state spatial practices. To concretize this theorization, this article closes with a brief historical reading of US imperial expansion and urbanization between roughly 1898 and 1925. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Having given birth to their children, the participants face a second obstacle: the lack of policies that support work-life balance. A third obstacle also arises, in the form of a lack of childcare and early-education provision, particularly in the UK. The last two obstacles affect the whole population, but they are intensified in the case of solo-mother-families where the mother is responsible for simultaneously being the caregiver and the sole economic provider. Solo motherhood by choice highlights the impact of the absence of these policies, and the inequalities that result from current contemporary conceptualizations of family, woman and early-childhood-care and education. This article draws on ethnographic research that took place in the UK and Spain where I conducted 60 in-depth interviews and participant observations.

Theoretical approach: starting from a Marxian perspective, we believe that debates about the productivity of reproductive work should overcome analyzes based on the immediacy of this work and apprehend the determinants that involve the absorption of work by capital as productive, reproductive or unproductive work. Methods: we collected secondary statistical data provided by IBGE, Sebrae and the British Cleaning Council, the analysis was based on historical materialism. Results: we demonstrate that capital has productively appropriated reproductive work, however, such appropriation has not meant changing the conditions of sexual division of labor and women's exhaustion. Conclusion: we conclude that instead of the transmutation of reproductive to productive work being an advance towards the emancipation of women, it has been a source of greater exploitation of their workforce and of exhaustion, since such appropriation does not overcome the exploitation that engenders the universality of oppression under capitalism, according to the needs of valuing value. © 2023, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

Particularly gender-based factors, including care and reproductive work, exert pressure on these women and constitute major hurdles for successful entry into employment in Austria. Based on nine qualitative interviews with refugee women who swiftly gained entry to the labour market as well as ten qualitative interviews with experts from public and private support organisations, we investigate refugee women’s social and cultural capital as well as the individual agencies that foster paths into the labour market. We introduce the concept of enablement as the process of gathering the preconditions for overcoming the challenges that arise on that path. Finally, we illuminate the ways in which the three dimensions of individual, relational and institutional enablement interrelate and shape individual agency with regard to labour market integration. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Women’s1 lifelong health and nutrition status is intricately related to their reproductive history, including the number and spacing of their pregnancies and births, and for how long and how intensively they breastfeed their children. In turn, women’s reproductive biology is closely linked to their social roles and situation, including regarding economic disadvantage and disproportionate unpaid work. Recognizing, as well as reducing and redistributing women’s care and domestic work (known as the ‘Three Rs’), is an established framework for addressing women’s inequitable unpaid care work. However, the care work of breastfeeding presents a dilemma, and is even a divisive issue, for advocates of women’s empowerment, because reducing breastfeeding and replacing it with commercial milk formula risks harming women’s and children’s health. It is therefore necessary for the interaction between women’s reproductive biology and infant care role to be recognized in order to support women’s human rights and enable governments to implement economic, employment and other policies to empower women. In this paper, we argue that breastfeeding–like childbirth–is reproductive work that should not be reduced and cannot sensibly be directly redistributed to fathers or others. Rather, we contend that the Three Rs agenda should be reconceptualized to isolate breastfeeding as ‘sexed’ care work that should be supported rather than reduced with action taken to avoid undermining breastfeeding. This means that initiatives toward gender equality should be assessed against their impact on women’s ability to breastfeed. With this reconceptualization, adjustments are also needed to key global economic institutions and national statistical systems to appropriately recognize the value of this work. Additional structural supports such as maternity protection and childcare are needed to ensure that childbearing and breastfeeding do not disadvantage women amidst efforts to reduce gender pay gaps and gender economic inequality. Distinct policy interventions are also required to facilitate fathers’ engagement in enabling and supporting breastfeeding through sharing the other unpaid care work associated with parents’ time-consuming care responsibilities, for both infants and young children and related household work.

Based on in-depth interviews with workers, firms and stakeholders, the objective of our study is to unravel the new mechanisms of exploitation and invisibility of this reproductive work, carried out mainly by migrant women from the Global south. This article deploys a feminist political economy approach to assess the new inequalities created by the intrusion of platform capitalism in the social reproduction sphere. Our study shows how the platform labour model fits perfectly in an informal and devalued care sector with a large labour supply composed of migrant women from the global South. Digital platforms take advantage of inequalities of gender, race, and immigration status to access a precarious workforce. The low reservation wage and lack of agency of migrant women, who are denied access to other sources of income and formal employment, act as key elements in the advancement of the mechanisms of exploitation and exclusion. Though care platforms facilitate access to work by migrant women, their working conditions are characteried by precarity, lack of access to social protection and unemployment benefits. Our results confirm that digital platforms have reinforced the ‘casualisation’ of labour markets, gendered segregation and subjugation in labour markets. © 2022 Oxfam KEDV.},

Together, these papers draw key theoretical and political insights for critical organization studies from the pandemic along three main lines. First, they examine how COVID-19 has denaturalized global capitalism, leading to a broad interrogation of the organization of the economy and our societies. Second, they point to how COVID-19 has unveiled the close relation between capital and the state in producing inequalities old and new, a relation that neoliberalism tends to hide from view. Third, they leverage COVID-19 to give voice to the largely female disposable workforce in the Global South on whose work global commodity flows, consumption and capital accumulation rest. We conclude by pointing to the need to address constitutive interdependencies, such as those between wage work and reproductive work, the global North and the global South, the market and the state, to name only a few. We further call for expanding traditional understandings of struggle to include a broader range of social antagonisms (e.g. for sufficient time to care, education, healthcare, housing, safe public spaces, accessible to all) as part of a theoretically and politically renewed organizational research agenda fostering solidarity. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Immigrant women from the global South are taking rising shares of domestic and care workloads in global North countries. Less attention has been devoted to national contexts, particularly from a quantitative perspective. Using large-scale nationally representative data for Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, this work presents a quantitative assessment of fertility and offspring mortality patterns among live-in domestic workers and their employers (patronas) during the second half of the 20th century. Our results indicate that the historically low and delayed fertility of live-in domestic workers stems from the confluence of socioeconomic disadvantages throughout their life courses, the everyday mobility constraints they face, the physical control exerted over them by their employers, and the expropriation of their daily and life course time by middle- and upper-class families. These results underline the stratified nature of reproduction in the Latin American context and urge scholars, particularly those working with quantitative data, to re-center research questions around the social mechanisms, including power relations, underpinning unequal living conditions and their consequences for the stratification of reproductive tasks. We use this evidence to argue that the increasingly feminized nature of domestic work and the rising trends of socioeconomic inequalities within and between countries render the examination of intersectionality-defined minorities central for a deeper understanding of family change beyond the Latin American context. © The Author(s) 2023.},

In this article, we examine the paid and reproductive experiences of mothers with preschool children in Canada, using a socio-ecological framework and a critical-feminist lens to explore the micro and macro environments that shape women’s home and work lives. To do this analysis, we completed demographic surveys, focus groups, and individual interviews with 58 mothers of preschool children in the Province of Alberta, Canada. The key finding discussed in this article is that for many participants, regardless of current job status (full-time, part-time or opt-out), the idealized solution to work-family integration challenges was part-time employment. Results suggest that although part-time employment was viewed as an ideal for many mothers, in practice, it proved to be a less-than-perfect solution for mothers attempting to integrate paid and unpaid work. Because earned income is the key source of financial well-being for the vast majority of Canadian households, and mothers’ marginalization in paid work may impede mothers’ income security and wellbeing, we posit that maternal employment is a key facet of gender equality that needs more attention in the scholarly literature. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The first lockdown, conferred upon us by the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, created a unique, 3-month-long, laboratory-like situation that made gender relations and women's work especially relevant for social research. Full-time employed parents who switched to working from home were in a unique position to renegotiate the division of housework, childcare, or the management of school-related tasks. This paper explores what happened to the gendered division of unpaid work and what factors explain the (failed) renegotiation between full-time working parents. To explore this issue, we interviewed 52 Hungarian-speaking mothers in two countries, Hungary and Romania, who were living in heterosexual dual-earner families with children under the age of 14, and who were working full-time. Results show that, despite the unusual situation, the usual pattern of the division of unpaid work was sustained by most parents. Even though they were unhappy and sometimes overwhelmed with their workload, most mothers did not mind the division of care duties. Research findings deliver evidence that mothers' lack of willingness and ability to renegotiate the division of unpaid labor in the household was determined both from “inside” and “outside” households. The gendered nature of care work and intensive parenting and mothers' position in the labor market, including the flexibility of their employment, are two sets of mutually interwoven factors that contributed to women's lack of willingness to challenge the unequal division of reproductive work. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Virginia Woolf's 1938 essay Three Guineas contends that the material basis is indispensable for women not only to survive but also to voice their political opinions. Woolf proposes three strategies for women to take. First, women should assert their right to have access to independent income, and for this purpose they should demand that the state pay for their reproductive work that often limits their opportunity to do waged work. Second, they must object to the very wage system which is indeed in complicity with patriarchy, and through which women are doubly exploited as unwaged or under-waged workers. And third, women must remain outside male-dominated movements and must organise an autonomous group even if they share the same cause with male workers; intersectional association will be possible only when each exploited group empowers itself and regains its own voice. This article examines how this highly materialist aspect of Woolf's feminism was revisited by the Wages for Housework movement in the 1970s. By so doing, it argues that despite its facade of literary modernism and alleged elitism, Woolf's text contributes to real-life movements and continues to inspire people of different class backgrounds in different times. Discovering the connection between Woolf and Marxist feminism alters our way of seeing the history of feminist theory: the history is never a linear progress from one wave to another but a complex and interwoven narrative, in which once-forgotten ideas can travel across time and space, resurging as new ideas in different contexts. © The Author(s) 2022.},

The research was conducted in Prik Tai, a Buddhist community in Sadao District, Songkhla Province, Southern Thailand. Research methods employed in this investigation were participant and non-participant observations and semi-structured interviews. Results show that disaster management in the Prik Tai community can be divided into three periods: 1988 to 1999, 2000 to 2009, and 2010 up to the present. The roles of women in the community were related to reproductive work, particularly household chores and care of family members. The women employed their skills in caring for the well-being of family members in disaster management and community work. In terms of gender division of labor, women played all three roles (production, reproductive work, and community work). Male roles in production and community work were labor-intensive and involved a higher level of risk than those of women. The female community core team members played key roles in social reproduction, household chores, unpaid services, and community work, which significantly contributed to the well-being of community members and vulnerable groups. However, the value and contribution of female social reproduction is not yet recognized by the state and society. It is vital to promote the social recognition of female social reproduction at the household and community levels, as one of the initial points in the process of decreasing gender inequality. © 2023 Common Ground Research Networks.

The article first analyzes the birth of the international movement "Wages for housework"in the context of which she established her feminist theorization, as well as the New York feminist collective in which Federici put in practice her theory. The article then traces the appropriations of her subversive conception of wages against capitalism in various contemporary mobilizations, at the same time when Federici herself is rather arguing for a politics of the commons in order to reclaim reproductive labor. Centering today her reflections on the role of reproductive work in the capitalist war against women, and how women can resist it, Federici proposes a collective and materialist conception of the body. This conception is today the object of theoretical and political debates, revealing Federici's work's continuing ability to inspire debates and action.  © Association Féminin Masculin Recherches.},

I ask: In a world marked not only by the threat of automation, precarity and market fundamentalism but also by climate change and its associated risks, what can we learn about the labour of communities responding to severe climate calamities? In documenting recovery work in post-hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico, I show how communities working toward reconstruction blur the lines between economic production and social reproduction. In addition, I also point to finance capital's ability to extract value from both productive and reproductive work, thus calling attention to labour geographers’ need to analyze both categories simultaneously. © 2021},

In Poland, the share of women involved in the “visible hand” groups was 80 percent. This article is based on the theoretical considerations of solidarity and mutual aid and points to the nexus of women and urban commons. It also presents the results of empirical research, based on mixed methods, devoted to the motivations of members to join affinity groups of this kind in the era of the pandemic as well as their expectations and the perceived benefits and dangers/threats. The obtained results contradict the stereotypical assumption that the high level of participation of women in self-help groups is related to the reproductive work they perform and the most important motivation for them is community building. There is also a finding related to women's agency, namely that all contemporary social movements mobilize a greater percentage of women. The members of the affinity groups surveyed see numerous benefits from their actions, both for others and for themselves (especially in psychological and social dimensions), and the most frequently indicated danger is dishonesty. The results of this research are an important contribution to both the theories of urban commons and informal organization of care. At the same time, the presented analysis of groups and their emotions, needs and calls for action may serve as an inspiration for both international comparative research and the very communities that are stuck up in crises (both current and those yet to come). © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The tax system both reacts to and helps create attitudes about the value of certain behaviors and choices. This Article makes three principal claims-one empirical, one normative, and one interpretative. The Article demonstrates through data that a representative sample of fertility clinics in the United States does not make information about the tax consequences of compensated human egg transfers-commonly called egg “donation”-publicly available. In 2015, in a case of first impression, the United States Tax Court decided in Perez v. Commissioner that a compensated egg transferor must report as income any amount she receives for her eggs. Although the Tax Court missed an opportunity to clarify further complex questions about the tax consequences of transfers of human bodily materials, the basic holding of Perez was clear. Even so, a content-based analysis of public internet forums and bulletin boards suggests that compensated egg transferors remain unclear about their tax obligations. This confusion is due in large part to the absence of what this Article calls “tax talk” on the part of the fertility clinics themselves. Women who receive compensation for providing eggs reject the idea that they are engaged in any sort of commercial activity, preferring to think of themselves as altruistic actors who receive money only because of their generosity and willingness to endure discomfort and inconvenience. Intended parents benefit from construing egg transferors as “donors” because that allows the intended parents to relegate compensation to a secondary role in any negotiations with the egg transferor. The absence of tax talk also allows intended parents to minimize the specter of “baby buying.” That cloud hovers over any assisted reproductive technology involving compensation for either gestational services or activity resulting in gamete transfers. Fertility clinics reinforce the altruism narrative and provide the foundation on which a multibillion-dollar industry stands. The absence of tax talk depresses the price of eggs and allows most of the industry profits to go to the drug manufacturers, the fertility clinics, and the doctors who own the clinics. They all profit handsomely from others' reproductive work. The normative solution to the absence of tax talk in the reproductive-technology context is for the Internal Revenue Service to issue clear guidance to all fertility clinics regarding the tax consequences of egg transfers. Furthermore, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine should require issuance of appropriate tax forms to compensated egg transferors. This will put taxpayers on notice of their filing obligations and likely increase tax compliance. From an interpretative perspective, taxing compensated egg transfers recognizes the importance of that activity. Taxation signals that reproductive work deserves to be treated like any other labor. The tax system thereby exercises its power to mark an activity as important and within the mainstream of human experience. The alternative-allowing compensated human egg transfers to escape taxation despite the law-turns compensated reproductive work into a preferred (and economically risky) type of labor activity with unintended consequences for women and others. © 2019 Boston University Law Review.

Based on this approach, the analysis unpacks the multiple trajectories of fragility the current crisis is intervening on and reshaping in the home and in the world of work, and their gendered and racialized features across the world. It shows how the pandemic and the measures to contain it have further deepened the centrality of households and reproductive work in the functioning of capitalism and argues that the transformative potential of the crisis can only be harnessed by framing policy and political responses around social reproduction and its essential contributions to work and life. HIGHLIGHTS A feminist social reproduction approach reveals the COVID-19 crisis as a crisis of work. The crisis is reshaping the organization of production and reproduction in households and global labor markets. This reorganization is exacerbating gender, class, and race inequalities. The pandemic has renewed the centrality of households in welfare provisioning and made social reproduction work visible.

Key to understanding these inequalities is attention to how people learn to cook, a relatively understudied topic by social scientists. To address this gap, this study employs the concept of cultural schemas. Drawing from qualitative interviews and observations of 34 primary cooks in families, I identify the ubiquity of a “cooking by our mother’s side” schema. This schema privileges culinary knowledge acquired during childhood through the social reproductive work of mothers. I argue, first, that this schema reproduces gendered inequalities over generations by reinforcing women as primary transmitters of cooking knowledge. Second, it presents an overly uniform picture of food learning that obscures diversity, especially by overemphasizing the importance of childhood and masking the learning that occurs later in life. Identifying and analyzing this schema offers opportunities to reconsider predominant approaches to food learning to challenge gendered inequalities in domestic foodwork. © 2019 by The Author(s).},

The concept of care traces its roots to a concern with the day-to-day reproductive work of households and the material significance of women’s domestic labour. The concept of care has broadened, reflecting both the complex nature of arrangements for caring in practice and the increasingly comparative nature of scholarship. The concept of social care also has an inherent dynamic which makes it suitable for studying change. Its dynamic lies in the idea of boundaries as applicable at both macro- and micro-level. The restructuring of social service provision of all kinds - housing, education and health as well as social care - has been most extensive in Britain.

Insofar as the ‘value-form’ is the distinctive social relation of capitalism, it appears necessary to ask whether the metabolic process of reproduction can be fully subsumed under this form. Marx takes for granted the idea that the reproduction of labor-power consists only in the consumption of commodities resulting from abstract labor, thus omitting the appropriation of unpaid domestic work, mostly performed by women. Feminist criticism clarifies how capitalism always depends on some reproductive work being appropriated for the accumulation of surplus-value without being integrated in the value-form. Following Jason W. Moore, I attempt to indicate that the same logic is at work for the reproduction of non-human life under the capitalist value-form, thus contradicting the sustainable reproduction of its own natural conditions. These two limitations of the capitalist subsumption of life open a new space for an expanded critique of capitalism, which goes beyond the exploitation of waged work by reflecting upon the concerns of feminist and ecological struggles. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

However, during the past decade, new forms of exclusive shared housing have emerged on the Swedish housing market. In contrast to international trends of vulnerable singles being forced to share housing, this Swedish example shows that also financially privileged singles reside in shared housing. Based on a survey of housing companies and a case study the article argues that mobility has been a driver for this new form of shared housing. In the article, ‘dwelling on-the-move together’ is identified as a new practice of residing in exclusive shared housing. This practice is characterised by sharing private, exclusive facilities, sharing paid services and sharing spaces for both home and work, in an environment that certifies that residents can come and go as they please while hired staff takes care of their property. While exclusive shared housing is an asset for residents, it also privatise facilities and reintroduces domestic workers to middle-class housing. In all, the marketization of shared housing risks introducing a stratification of shared housing which may reinforce the geographic and social polarisation of Swedish cities. © 2021 The Author(s).

The combination of motherization/demotherization and familialization/defamilialization yields four types of maternalism: "implicit," "traditional," "state-funded dematernalism," and "familialized dematernalism." Although the demotherization of care work leads to increased gender equality, it does not systematically challenge the gendered division of care work. © 2016 The Author.

This site of fantasy is moreover the one triggered by the trauma of natal separation. This in-between reality of the vernacular as a lost memory as well as a fantasy of the real makes it an ideal fetish figure for our times. I explain the fetish for the concrete in the context of a post-hegemonic, post-ideo-logical capitalist state that has abandoned its role of catering for the subsistence needs of food, clothing and shelter of its most marginalized people as well as those who are unemployed. The compensatory succour that used to be obtained from the reproductive work of women’s domestic labour is also in crisis, given the commod-itization of their care work. My article then looks at the gendered nature of the youth voices and subcultures filling this lack of systematic all-round care through the language of jugad. The valorization of jugad or the positing of concrete solu-tions to abstract problems actually gives us a lesson in the meaning of abstract labour, as something not merely confined to the realm of labour but to social forms (or use-values) constituted beyond the ambit of the market and judicial structures. © 2020 Intellect Ltd Article.

	abstract = {Research Framework: Femmes d’Aujourd’hui, Belgium’s first French-language women’s magazine, is mainly aimed at a female readership and transmits a discourse on contraception, while contributing to its construction. Objectives: We analyze it through a long chronological perspective (1960-2010) with regard to societal and legislative transformations in Belgium. How is birth control presented? Who is responsible for it? How is it transmitted? Methodology: Using a qualitative approach based on a systematic analysis of the review, we report on the evolution of the discourse on contraception as a fundamental dimension of reproductive work. Results: Contraception is initially presented as a shared responsibility within the couple, in accordance with the Christian orientation of the magazine and its journalists. Subsequently, birth control gradually became an exclusively female responsibility. Contraceptives are classified according to criteria of effectiveness that are put forward by the medical profession. At the turn of the millennium, information on contraceptive methods diversified and gave way to criticism in readers’ letters. Conclusions: By making the various methods visible with the aim of providing information above all, Femmes d’Aujourd’hui promotes a contraceptive and procreative norm. Thanks to contraceptive methods, motherhood can be achieved in compliance with social norms, prescribing in particular a certain time frame, when the type of contraceptive changes according to a maternity project. Finally, although it leaves room for debate via readers or journalists, the women’s press paradoxically contributes to the gendered assignment of birth control. Contribution: The discourse on contraception in Femmes d'Aujourd'hui contributes to the diffusion of an injunction to motherhood. In our research, we identify procreative norms that contribute to this. These evolve in two phases linked to the societal and legislative context. © 2021 Centre - Urbanisation Culture Societe de l'INRS. All rights reserved.},

Estos procesos han tenido implicancias específicas para las trabajadoras agrícolas, quienes afrontan la condición de precariedad laboral del sector, a la vez que experimentan desigualdades que las afectan distintivamente. Este artículo propone analizar conjuntamente los procesos de trabajo productivo y reproductivo de trabajadoras agrícolas migrantes residentes en Mendoza (Argentina), buscando dilucidar la incidencia de esta doble carga en su salud-enfermedad. A partir del trabajo de campo, realizado desde el año 2014 en la localidad agrícola de Ugarteche, Luján de Cuyo, mediante un enfoque cualitativo apoyado primordialmente en la estrategia biográfica, y con la colaboración de herramientas conceptuales feministas, analizamos las relaciones entre trabajo y salud desde la forma en que estos procesos son narrados por las mujeres migrantes.

These processes have had specific implications for female agricultural workers, who face the precarious working conditions common to all agricultural workers as well as inequalities that affect them distinctly. This article seeks to analyze the productive and reproductive work of migrant female farmworkers residing in Mendoza (Argentina), in order to elucidate the impact of this double workload on their health-disease processes. Fieldwork was carried out in 2014 in the agricultural town of Ugarteche, Luján de Cuyo, using a qualitative method supported primarily in a biographical approach. With the collaboration of feminist theoretical tools, we analyzed the relation between work and health based on the way these processes are narrated by migrant women. The results show that the work processes impacting their health include both employment and reproductive labor, and describe the harm, diseases, and illnesses linked to combined work in farms, factories and homes. © 2018 Universidad Nacional de Lanús.},

In addition, a number of misunderstandings regarding the common wealth, the city, the state, and the public sphere do not help to clarify the meaning of the commons. As a response to these problems, I first devise two useful concepts that stem from Marx’s original insights: primary and extended commons. Secondly, I critically examine the institutionalist views on urban commons due to their limitations in advancing anti-capitalist perspectives while also identifying some problems with the Marxist accounts. The different expressions of cooperative housing and squatting serve to illustrate how anti-capitalist urban commons are actually highly developed, despite significant restrictions that are also examined here. Hence, I argue that both the analysis and politics of urban commoning should focus on the joint contentious, cooperative, and democratic practices of the global working class when they deal with essential reproductive work and means of production which are widely independent from state rule and exploitative capitalist relations. © 2020. - University of Salento, SIBA: http://siba-ese.unisalento.it.

It is precisely within the relationship between outside and inside, public and private, production and reproduction that lie many of the contradictions and the potentialities of living.

	abstract = {The ongoing global crisis not only poses challenges for critical empirical analyses, it also forces us to reconsider central analytical concepts. This paper takes the multiple crisis as a starting point to reconsider notions of (state) power, hegemony, and subjectivation in contemporary crisis management. We discuss recent analyses by feminist and neo-Gramscian scholars, highlight their valuable contributions to a richer understanding of current crisis politics, and argue for their mutual complementarity. Neo-Gramscian perspectives, which productively highlight the current conjuncture's increasing (lack of) hegemonic qualities, need to be confronted with feminist insights regarding the current transformations of gender orders. In combining these approaches, we develop the notion of ‘crisis management by subjectivation’. To illustrate this we refer to the example of Greece: increasingly coercive and authoritarian modes of governance parallel the re-privatization of reproductive work and increasing reliance on gendered division of labor, traditional concepts of privacy, and gendered knowledge of care and the practices associated with it for the reproduction of social cohesion. With the notion of ‘crisis management by subjectivation’ we hence refer to the fact that austerity policies draw on a gendered (re-)allocation and subjective incorporation of social responsibilities as hidden resources of stability and hegemony. The crisis, through its management, is displaced into the gendered subjects themselves. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

For the Mengen workers the plantation is simultaneously a place of hard and controlled labor, a site of earning sorely needed monetary income, and a place to momentarily escape relations in the village. The vast majority of Mengen workers are oriented towards village life and channel substantial amounts of their income back to the village. By examining the circulation of things and people between the plantation and surrounding villages, I look at how the two places, and the larger orders they represent, are in a direct, unequal, and complex relation with one another. While the surrounding villages subsidize the plantation and provide cheap labor, for the Mengen workers, the plantation is a place for reproducing village life and a generative place of forming new social relations. As both an oppressive and generative place, it is for the Mengen highly ambiguous, as are the larger orders it materializes and stands for. © 2018 Finnish Anthropological Society.

	abstract = {Gender gaps in some aspects of the labour market in Europe narrowed during the recent economic crisis, mainly because men were hit harder and because of the ‘added worker effect’. Therefore, the number of families with a single wage-earner, in particular female-headed households, increased. However, the differential impact of the crisis on male and female labour force in part was an unintended effect of the ‘gendered’ and ‘racialized’ structure of the labour market. Occupational concentration in care and reproductive work and the public sector in fact protected women from unemployment. Adopting an intersectional approach and using individual and household data from the Labour Force Survey from 2008 to 2015, the aim of this paper is to assess to what extent the gendered and ‘racialized’ structure of the Italian labour market has changed, both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view, and to what extent the increase in female breadwinner families, especially among migrants, hides widening or narrowing intersectional inequalities by gender and citizenship. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Introduction/objectives: Reproductive labour refers to activities and tasks directed at caregiving and domestic roles, such as cleaning, cooking, and childcare. Productive labour refers to activities that involve economic remuneration. The aim of the present study was to analyse physical activity, sedentary behaviour, physical fitness, and cognitive performance in women with fibromyalgia who engaged, or did not engage, in productive work. Method: This cross-sectional study comprised 276 women with fibromyalgia from Andalusia (southern of Spain). Levels of physical activity (light, moderate, and vigorous) and sedentary behaviour were measured by an accelerometer. Physical fitness and cognitive performance were measured with a battery of performance-based tests. Results: More hours/week of homemaker-related tasks were associated with higher time spend in light physical activity and lower sedentary behaviour (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, in comparison with those who only engaged in reproductive labour, women with fibromyalgia who engaged in productive work showed lower levels of sedentary behaviour and higher levels of light and moderate physical activity, physical fitness (except muscular strength), and cognitive performance (all, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Altogether, our findings suggest that productive work is consistently related to better physical and cognitive functioning in women with fibromyalgia. If future research corroborates causality of our findings, then, to maintain women with fibromyalgia engaging in productive work may be strived for not only because of societal or economic reasons but also for better health. However, we should keep in mind that people with fibromyalgia have a chronic condition, and therefore, adaptations at the workplace are imperative.Key Points• Women with fibromyalgia, who spend more time in reproductive labour, have higher levels of light physical activity and lower sedentary behaviour; however, it is associated with poorer general health (as lower physical fitness or cognitive performance).• Household tasks are often seen as a responsibility associated with the gender roles that women with fibromyalgia perform, despite the feelings of incapacity they cause. Policies focused on reducing reproductive labour demands for fibromyalgia patients (i.e. social help on housework or childcare) might facilitate the inclusion of daily active behaviours.• People with fibromyalgia who engage in productive work seem to have better health outcomes than those who have not; however, we cannot forget that adaptations and flexibility at the workplace are imperative. © 2019, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).},

	abstract = {Objectives Coinciding with the outbreak of the economic crisis that began in 2008, in Catalonia there has been a continued growth of socio-economic initiatives within the framework of Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE), a sector characterised by significant female participation. In a context of high economic and vital vulnerability women have generated, amongst other, responses aimed at satisfying individual and collective needs through cooperative management. Within the ‘Crisis and female alternatives’ research project we have analysed such socio-economic alternatives led by women in Catalonia from the Feminist Economics (FE) conceptual framework, in order to understand to what extent they may be reproducing social inequalities. As a contribution to the dialogue between SSE and FE, we have addressed this concern by reflecting on the degree of democratisation of the SSE sector in Catalonia in terms of its inclusiveness, i.e. the existing options to access it. Our main research question is what does it mean to democratize the economy from the feminist perspective? In this article we address the hypothetical absence of inequalities reproduction in two ways: in terms of the participation of the socio-economically disadvantaged sectors, as well as in terms of the overcoming of the hierarchy between the productive and reproductive dimensions of the economy Methods In order to identify the axes of inequality that constrain the real possibilities for the participation of women in SSE, we have interviewed and analysed the profile of 17 women in four areas of SEE activity: care and attention to people (7 initiatives), agroecology (4), housing (3), and construction of community networks (3). The SSE experiences analysed are located either in the Barcelona metropolitan region or in Central Catalonia. The selection of these four areas is motivated by the fact that they develop an economic activity that unifies production and reproduction in the resolution of diverse needs. The simultaneous approach to both spheres of socio-economic experiences is a premise of the Feminist Economics conceptual and analytical framework. The first group includes initiatives for the care of the elderly, people in a situation of functional dependence and young children. The second group includes initiatives for the consumption, processing and/or distribution of agroecological food. The third group includes two housing cooperatives (one under construction and the other in the project development phase at the time of the fieldwork). Finally, the fourth group includes initiatives that seek to promote and build interpersonal and/or community links. The selection of the initiatives was made after a preliminary mapping in each territory of SSE experiences in the four sectors of interest and ease of access to informants. In terms of format, the initiatives include 6 associations, 7 cooperatives, 1 self-managed parenting group, 1 family farming enterprise, 1 trade union and 1 platform. All but one are small-format initiatives, in line with the majority profile of SSE initiatives in Catalonia, which are small and cooperative in format. This sample was complemented by 5 interviews with informants from three key sectors for the development of the SSE in Catalonia: public administration (socio-economic innovation), Cooperative Athenaeums and ethical finance. All interviews were recorded with the informed consent of the interviewees and subsequently anonymised and coded for in-depth qualitative analysis using Atlas.ti. Results The results presented in this article suggest that the SSE, as it is currently organized, presents limitations or difficulties in reversing some of the inequalities on which the capitalist market economy is built, both productive and reproductive. In particular, the analysis of the interviews with women participating in cooperative projects suggests that in the generation of socioeconomic alternatives within the SSE, inequalities of access are reproduced along five axes: socio-economic level, educational level, place of origin, family responsibilities, and political-relational capital. This result is also supported by the key informants interviewed. In the area of productive or paid work, socioeconomic level, together with educational level and relational capital, are determinants for access to these alternatives. The participation in the SSE of the women interviewed is not explained so much by the urgency of responding to basic needs as by the capacity for collective action and the presence of other resources such as capital, education and relationships. Women with more precarious socioeconomic profiles do not have a significant presence in cooperative initiatives. Thus, what drives most of these initiatives is more the ideological commitment to a certain way of generating employment and economic activity than a need for self-employment per se. Origin articulates a fourth axis of inequality, since women of non-EU origin are practically absent from the SSE. Likewise, the (few) women of non-EU origin who work in cooperative projects develop activities linked to reproductive and care work, socio-labour insertion or specific work with the migrant population, all sectors characterized by their low social value and high labour precariousness. In the area of the unpaid or reproductive economy, we analysed the ability to reconcile a paid activity with family care responsibilities, following the contributions of the FE, which takes into consideration all the work necessary for subsistence, well-being and social reproduction. Thus, although the need to reconcile work with family life and caregiving responsibilities seems to be an important reason for many women to join the SSE, this expectation is often frustrated and only materializes in certain situations or family situations. As a generator of inequalities in access, the options available for managing family responsibilities also have an impact on the possibilities for women to become involved in the SSE, as well as on the conditions under which they do so. If these first two dimensions show important weaknesses when it comes to facilitating economic alternatives in the SSE field, the last factor analysed, relational capital, appears as a key factor in explaining participation in this field, combined with an important ideological motivation and the presence of resources for collective action. Conclusions, original value and limitations This article contributes to fill the lack of empirical studies that analyse in detail the SSE sector. As an added value, the originality of this contribution lies in the fact that it is framed in the dialogue between SSE and Feminist Economics. These are two critical economy sectors on the rise that, although sharing the proposal of alternative socioeconomic models that place people’s lives and needs at the centre of economic activity, they diverge in the scope of their transformative potential. We have sought to deepen the democratizing project of the economy claimed by the SSE from the FE framework. Assuming non-reproduction of inequalities as the objective of any socioeconomic project that is considered transformative, we have problematized the feminization of SSE to detect inequalities of access and identify which women are most favoured for participation in this type of alternative economic initiatives. Our results suggest that the SSE, as it is currently organized, presents limitations or difficulties in reversing some of the inequalities on which the capitalist market economy is built, both productive and reproductive, showing weaknesses when it comes to facilitating economic alternatives for women. Consequently, we can affirm that the transformative potential of the SSE as a democratizing alternative for the economy is called into question if we analyse its degree of inclusiveness, since there is a risk of generating a model that is only accessible to certain socioeconomic profiles. Addressing this risk is a major challenge for the sector. In this regard, our results suggest the relevance and need to deepen the analysis of socioeconomic processes from currently non-hegemonic perspectives. Among them, the FE perspective allows us to problematize these processes, explicitly incorporating their reproductive dimension. This critical view is particularly necessary in areas that are intended to be transformative, such as the SSE. Among other issues, as future lines of work to address the challenge of feminist democratization of the SSE, we identified the need to explore the degree of recognition of reproductive work in cooperative initiatives beyond the discursive, i.e., if and how this recognition is operationalized. Likewise, it is necessary to continue exploring the tension between vital (personal) time and commercial (collective) time involved in the work overload that women in the SSE report. Addressing the precariousness of women’s work and life in the SSE sector involves identifying, among other things, innovative formulas for care co-responsibility and time use that are not currently being generated. The FE also allows us to highlight non-monetarized socioeconomic practices. In this sense, a closer look at the processes of mutual support and empowerment often linked to women’s participation in SSE is particularly interesting. Continuing to advance in the analysis of the convergences and divergences between SSE and FE would finally allow us to analyse whether and how the SSE is responding to women’s productive and reproductive economic needs. Indeed, this last key issue is related to the limitations we can bring up related to our study, as this approach to both productive and reproductive dimensions of the economy is a challenge both conceptually, when combining conventional and non-conventional indicators and empirically, when analysing socioeconomic initiatives. Addressing this challenge is, at the same time, a main contribution of the research here presented. © 2021. CIRIEC-España.},

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how patterns of time-use translate into patterns of physical activity and energy expenditure, particularly in rural areas where seasonal agricultural labour plays such an important role. We address this gap by integrating energy expenditure data derived from wearable tri-axial accelerometers with time-use data from conventional recall-based surveys. Using datasets from agricultural households in four rural communities in India and Nepal, our results show that there are significant gender differences in the patterns of time-use and energy expenditure. Men and women participate equally in productive work, however, women shoulder most of the additional reproductive work burdens in rural households at the expense of leisure opportunities. Our results provide insights into women's responses to opportunities for productive work and highlight the nature of trade-offs they face. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Research context: In line with materialist feminist analyses, this article revisits the boundaries between so-called productive versus reproductive work to deconstruct their foundations and show that, behind the social organization of procreation, there is work for which women are primarily responsible. Objectives: The purpose of this introduction is to examine the production of children and the decision not to have them through the lens of procreative work, thus integrating the different tasks involved in procreation, non-procreation and child rearing. This will also demonstrate the importance of thinking about the right to the work of procreation within the social norms that frame the multiple sequences of the (non)production of new human beings. Methodology: This introductory article is based on a review of literature that clarifies the key concepts of “procreative work” and “procreative rights” that are used to analyze the tasks associated with procreation - understood in a broad sense – in order to contextualize the various articles in this issue. Results: While demonstrating the heuristic power of the conceptual choices made, the article highlights areas of resistance to the analysis of procreative work and opens up multiple avenues of investigation to broaden this topic for a comprehensive, international and interdisciplinary understanding of the field of procreation. Conclusion: The interpretation proposed as a framework for thinking about the production of children and the decision to not have them, and what this implies for women, allows an array of everyday tasks that are particularly time-consuming and yet unnoticed to be brought to light. It highlights the need to integrate the different approaches, including legal norms, that constitute the social framework for procreative work. Contribution: This article synthesizes knowledge regarding the concepts used to analyze tasks related to the (non)production of children. © 2021 Centre - Urbanisation Culture Societe de l'INRS.

The methodology was based on descriptive statistics based on the raw data from the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), assessing application, competitiveness and spending parameters. The analysis of these parameters reveals that the parties strictly complied with the minimum level of female candidates defined by law, of 30% of the names in the party lists. In addition, there was a possible effect of marital status in interaction with gender unfavorable to female representation. In addition, there was a possible effect of marital status in interaction with gender unfavorable to female representation. This data seems to reflect, in the electoral arena, more general findings regarding the variation in gender inequality in Brazil associated with the sexual division of reproductive work. To describe the competitiveness of candidates, a typology was developed based on the rule that defines the minimum level of 10% electoral quotient as a requirement for obtaining representation. An expressive contingent of subcompetitive women was observed. This helps to explain another finding explored in the article: The fact that the additional seats in the state legislatures obtained by the expressiveness of the voting of a few "vote-pulling" women were, in general, filled by men. Finally, the article reveals that, considering the same volume of campaign resources, the vast majority of men receive more votes than women. The description of gender inequality from the proportional elections of 2018 dialogues directly with the main themes of the literature on gender inequality in politics. It is hoped that the analysis undertaken in the article will contribute to the dialogue and actions that aim to promote greater equality between men and women in Brazilian politics. © 2020 Centro Universitario de Brasilia.

	abstract = {Objective: This paper analyzes the meaning of working in Women with Productive Work (WPW) and Women with Reproductive Work (WRW) in Cali city, Colombia. To achieve this purpose, four dimensions proposed by the MOW (1987) were studied: centrality, social norm and work values, kind of work and work trajectories. Method: A qualitative research was carried out based on phenomenological design. Semi-structured interview guides. Six WPW and six WRW were chosen randomly with an age among 30 and 40 years. Results: It was found that the WPW present more centrality than the WRW; also, the WPW’s rights are based on legal aspects, while WRW’s rights are based on symbolic values associated to the recognition of their relatives. The duties of the WPW are focused on the specific function of their job’s nature, meanwhile for the WRW their duties cover all daily tasks demanded from their household. Women with productive occupations have their work values highlighted by bigger incomes, more independency, flexible schedules and the prospect of occupying a directive position; as long as for the women with a reproductive occupation they are encouraged for getting a better income to supply their own necessities or the family’s, as well as to rely on their respective partner’s or family’s support. Conclusion: Both groups have been permeated by a default genre perspective that empowers a sexual division of the work activities, such that it is taken for granted that women are responsible for all the household activities and reproductive work even when they are performing the same productive activities as their partners, whose participation in such household activities is usually regarded as a help or even a favor, not as a shared responsibility. © 2018 by Psicogente.},

Furthermore, it sets out some theoretical concepts that support our analysis: using Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology, it defines the concept of the social field, the capitals that form it, and the notion of trajectory. By delving into the empirical data, the chapter analyzes the accounts given by our interviewees on their families’ rural origins, mobility strategies, and insertion into the labor market. These issues will be correlated with the women’s current work overload, the gender mandates they experience, and the sexual division of labor among families. Finally, we will conclude by showing how the transgenerational obligation of sustaining family care is, contradictorily, a factor that impinges on the women while simultaneously being an element of female agency. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {This paper seeks to advance our understanding of the gendered implications of land dispossession. It does so through a comparative analysis of five cases of rural land dispossession driven by different economic purposes in diverse agrarian contexts: the English enclosures; colonial and post-colonial rice irrigation projects in The Gambia; large dams in India; oil palm cultivation in Indonesia; and special economic zones in India. The paper first identifies some of the very common gendered effects of dispossession. In each case, it shows that land dispossession reproduced women’s lack of independent land rights or reversed them where they existed, intensified household reproductive work and occurred without meaningful consultation with–much less decision-making by–rural women. The paper secondly demonstrates ways in which the gendered consequences of land dispossession vary across forms of dispossession and agrarian milieux. The most important dimension of this variation is the effect of land loss on the gender division of labour, which is often deleterious but varies qualitatively across the cases examined. The paper also illustrates important variation within dispossessed populations as gender intersects with class, caste and other inequalities. The paper concludes that land dispossession consistently contributes to gender inequality, albeit in socially and historically specific ways. So while defensive struggles against land dispossession will not in themselves transform patriarchal social relations, they may be a pre-condition for more offensive struggles for gender equality. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this article I use an intersectional approach in order to understand how their different positions in life affected their ability to cope with the crisis situation. I present a longitudinal qualitative study of the situation of solo mothers in the Czech Republic during the Covid-19 crisis, based on repeated interviews with women from three Czech regions. The preliminary findings indicate that a crucial factor in the women's ability to cope with increased care responsibilities was the kind of job they had before the pandemic hit. Women with higher qualifications and stable jobs faced a decline in income coupled with stress resulting from a conflation of paid work and care. In response, they reduced their professional ambitions. Women who were unemployed or lost their job during the pandemic faced long-term unemployment, and the jobs that they were offered on the labour market were forms of precarious employment. For all of them, irrespective of their work situation, the pandemic deepened their sense of vulnerability, and all of them experienced some form of economic hardship. The lack of any systemic support and the ignoring of the needs of (solo) parents (and children) were accompanied by the individual responsibilisation of the mothers. As a consequence, old inequalities deepened and new ones emerged. © 2021 Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Institute of Sociology. All rights reserved.},

Through the commercialization of agriculture, employment opportunities inside and outside the sector are expected to be created. Both women and men are integrated into this new agriculture production system. Based on a mixed-method approach, this paper provides insights into current transformations of the rural labour market. The feminization debates build the theoretical background. The empirical results show that wage employment is created almost exclusively in the informal sector, typically for casual on-field agriculture workers. It is apparent that for the same work, women earn approximately 20% less than men. Women play an important role in the rural labour market while carrying the main bulk of reproductive work. The agricultural transformation is gendered, and due to reproductive work, women do not have the same opportunities in the paid labour market. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Population ageing and urbanization are two global trends that together comprise major forces shaping the 21st century. At the same time as cities are growing, their share of residents aged 65 years and more is increasing. The world is currently experiencing two major demographic transitions: the ageing of populations and urbanization. The trend in today's planetary human society is restructuring throughout two fundamental and simultaneous processes with serious socio-economic implications. The urban environment influences the health and quality of older people's life. By 2050, more than two-thirds of the world's population will be living in cities. And, at least, a quarter of urban populations will be aged 65 and over, with significant implications for urban planning and development. Increasingly, cities will need to balance their role as drivers of economic development with responsibilities for improving the quality life of elderly people. In 2015, worldwide, 8 percent of the population is over 65 years and in the most developed and urbanized countries the percentage raises to 17 percent. Between 1950 and 2015, the total world population increased by 191 percent. However, in the same period, the population of older people rose by a much larger proportion. Between 1950 and 2000 the proportion of those over 65 grew by 218 percent and the population of people aged 80 or more by 386 percent. In the last fifteen years this process has intensified even more. Currently, developed countries have the greatest proportion of elders, but in a few decades many developing countries will reach the same levels of aging. In 2015 the percentage in Latin America reached 7 percent while in the European Union it is 19 percent. In an attempt to diversify the long interval between the onset of aging and increasingly advanced centenarian ages, for testing purposes, this broad age group has been disaggregated into three subgroups: young old (65-74 years), old old (75-84 years) and very old (over 85 years). These subgroups show a relatively greater internal homogeneity, considering both patterns of biological clock and, above all, the social clock indicating the changes that occur in both economic activity and capabilities intellectual, cognitive, health, life expectancy. The ageing population, a process registered not only in all developed countries, is due to the reduction tendency of birth and fertility and at the same time, to the decreasing of mortality and an important extension of the life expectancy at birth. Population ageing is not "gender-neutral". The evolution to an older age structure changes the balance in numbers of men and women in the whole population. Men's higher mortality over the life course means that women typically outnumber men at older ages, and the difference is quite large among the oldest old. We must take into account that older people have a gradual loss of physical and mental faculties that they previously had. This process is the first cause of the transition generally to less mobility and repetitive spatial behaviors that are dominated by a certain rejection to change, especially to change the habitual place of residence. In general, older people want to stay at home, but his progressive loss of health and personal autonomy generates serious problems for families who must deal with their care. Not so long ago, the relatives have always been the people who had assumed the care of the elderly in their own homes, often because women were made usually responsible for reproductive work. However, due to the incorporation of women into the workplace and the increasing number of long-lived people, many women refuse to give up their jobs to care for their grandparents or parents. At present, older people in situations of dependency have to realize that informal care is no longer an option due to changes in traditional family values. However, in the current economic crisis, seniors are sometimes the ones aiding their economically uncertain families. This happens in those countries being hardest hit by the economic crisis. In general, society tends to convey a negative image of older people associated with dependence and vulnerability, regardless of the diversity of situations that arise in this heterogeneous age group, ignoring the positive aspects of aging as is the accumulated experience. And this is accentuated in urban areas that are not designed for the needs of this age group, especially the most dependent. Urbanists, planners and managers of city governments should be aware that any transformation of urban spaces entails territorial identities and sense of place of older people. © 2016 Universidad Nacional Autonóma de México.},

	abstract = {Parenthood or parental responsibilities may be defined as parents' practical and functional capacities to care for and raise their children and ensure their healthy development. Such capacities are acquired through parents' or carers' biology, heredity, life experience and interaction with the sociocultural context. Parenting skills and behaviours can be learned and exercised irrespective of conjugal arrangements (Lupica, 2013). One of the factors impacting parenthood most heavily in recent years is women's wholesale entry on the labour market and the family role changes involved. At year-end 2017, 50.2 % of Latin American and Caribbean women were engaged in paid employment (OIT, 2017). Despite their substantial implication in the working world, women continue to assume the primary responsibility for household and family care tasks. On average, women devote nearly three times as many hours per week to unpaid work as men (37.2 vs 13.3), whereas men spend twice as much time in paid work (39.3 vs 19.3). (Observatorio de Igualdad de Género de América Latina y el Caribe-CEPAL, 2018). One essential consideration for furthering women's employability is advancement toward social co-responsibility for care, i.e., with the intervention of families, the State, the marketplace and society from the perspective of parenthood, to foster greater equality between men and women. Such changes would seek to build a society in which women and men can be paid workers as well as carers (OIT-PNUD, 2009; Lupica, 2013). Greater male involvement in family care also has a beneficial effect on children's future and personal development, not to mention the fatherly satisfaction experienced by men who establish a rewarding and happy relationship with their children (IPPF/WHR and Promundo, 2017; Barker and Verani, 2008). The traditional identification of men with paid and women with reproductive work largely explains why restructuring women's and men's working time meets so much social resistance. Labour market organisation reinforces that resistance, which also hampers men's greater commitment to care. The model informing regional labour legislation, traditional two-parent families resulting from stable conjugal unions, determines the profile of the ideal worker: a male who works overly long hours and devotes very little time to family responsibilities and his personal life (Lupica, 2013). Consequently, the provisions on work/life balance in most of the region are geared nearly exclusively to women in their dual role as workers and mothers, rather than to men, whose role as workers appears to rest on the existence of a woman able to meet their children's needs for care. That assumption is implicit in the distribution of mothers' and fathers' leaves and the regulation of on-site day care services and their association with working women. The acknowledgement of fathers' right to participate in the care for their newborn children in the form of short-term paternity leave (2 to 15 days) is the regional legislative measure that has had the greatest impact on men's and women's joint participation in care work. Men are not, however, entitled to job protection and in most cases their access to on-site day care services is restricted. Very few national legislations envisage leave to care for workers' children or other family members when ill and parental leave has only been implemented in four countries: Brazil, Chile, Cuba and Uruguay. Countries in the region consequently need to undertake legislative reform to provide for parenthood-focused maternity protection and support for workers with family responsibilities to enable mothers and fathers to share the tasks involved in care. Under parental leave provisions workers can extend the right to care beyond women's reproductive role (pregnancy, childbirth, recovery and nursing) and upend the old «male breadwinner, woman carer' model. That notwithstanding, legislative provisions do not suffice to ensure that responsibility for care is shared by men and women. Affirmative action and social policies are also needed to further the necessary social and cultural change, foster active or committed paternity and make social responsibility for care effective in practice. © 2017 Ministerio de Empleo y Seguridad Social.

Building on critical political economy, feminist thought, and urban theory, I examine infrastructure as a resource in the lives of city-dwellers and as a potential site of exploitation in platform economies. The chapter’s conceptual contribution is the notion of ‘infrastructural surplus’, which names the value that platforms are able to extract by grafting their operations onto the urbanised landscape. I offer a preliminary ‘anatomy’ of various sources of infrastructural surplus and discuss two modes of extraction: the reformatting of social spaces and transactional exclusion. In the reformatting mode, spaces of consumption are reconfigured as logistical infrastructures for platform operations; in the transactional exclusion mode, infrastructure becomes a vital reproductive asset in the invisible, uncompensated, reproductive work required pf platform labour. I conclude by discussing the implications of infrastructural surplus for regulation. © Jeroen Meijerink, Giedo Jansen and Victoria Daskalova 2021.},

Yet, the dominant narrative within the state-led Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD) tends to be a gender-blind migration for development approach, which emphasises national-level economic growth at the centre of migration processes, while negating the subjectivities of women migrants and neglecting their contributions to the global economy; this approach diverts attention to a narrow focus on macro-economic development through forms of financial remittances. Based on an examination of the GFMD as a site for gender mainstreaming M&D, we reflect on lessons learned as we look forward to achieving the SDGs. We argue that while the SDGs include some significant provisions for women in migration, only critical civil society advocacy and activism networked within grassroots organisations can address the structural changes necessary (such as a re-articulation of the care economy to value economic contributions of women’s reproductive work) to transform and improve the lived realities of women in migration and realise the SDGs in a manner that fosters their empowerment. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Limited attention has been given to the effects of labour migration on the reproductive lives of women ‘left behind’ as their partners travel for work. Drawing on two rounds of qualitative interviews with 20 women in the central hill region of Nepal, this paper examines how global economic processes that lead Nepali men to travel for work also affect women’s reproductive work, including childrearing and reproductive decision-making. Women understood their husband’s migration to engage in the wage economy as a response to both immediate and long-term goals for their children and family. As a result, such productive work was intrinsically linked to reproductive work. Men’s migration patterns played a pivotal role in reinforcing women’s immediate childrearing roles and affecting whether and when women used a contraceptive method and what methods they considered. During periods of spousal migration, women’s reproductive lives became targets of gossip and rumours as their intimate and reproductive practices and use of remittances were socially monitored. This complex understanding of women’s lived experiences at the nexus of (re)productive work and labour migration can be practically applied to address the reproductive health needs of women with migrant spouses in Nepal. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The topic of large-scale land acquisition (LSLA) has attracted wide interest in the literature and the media. However, there is little work on the gendered institutional changes and gendered impacts on common pool resources (CPR) due to LSLA. The aim of this paper is to address these impacts. This is done by discussing data from participatory research (using the methods of participatory observation, semi-structured and narrative interviews, biographies, focus group discussions, value chain analysis, and household questionnaires) on a forestry plantation operated by the British investor, the New Forests Company (NFC) in the Kilolo district, in the Iringa region. The institutional arrangements regarding different land-related common pool resources from pre-colonial times until the arrival of this investment will be shown. Furthermore, how these arrangements have changed over time and since the LSLA is presented. Then, the effects on men's and women's access to CPR and, thus, the impacts on their capacities to perform their reproductive work and resilience will be addressed. Furthermore, the paper focuses on how different stakeholders in the land deal (the investor, the government, different local people) make use of these different institutions to push through their own interests regarding the land. Finally, the paper looks at collective compensation payments (such as monetary compensation and jobs) and forms of corporate social responsibility (CSR) schemes, and how they are perceived emically. It is argued that the LSLA in this case clearly grabs land and land-related common pool resources that were previously held in common. Women, such as daughters, sisters, and wives, had specific access and property rights to these. Thus, the paper concludes that this grabbing lowers women's resilience and deprives them of important resources for their livelihoods, and for food and cash production at critical times. CSR programmes and compensation rarely reach women and are, for them, an anti-politics machine, hiding the grabbing processes, and impacting the poorest of the poor, while the company uses a development discourse to legitimise its activities. In fact, the people perceive the investment as trapping them in underdevelopment. © 2020 by the authors.},

This paper draws on the concept of the triple burden in theorizing the gender divisions in productive and reproductive work and community activities in the context of disaster. Events that include famine, war, natural disaster or disease outbreak are all well documented as increasing women's vulnerability to a worsening of gendered burdens. In the case of the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, this is no different. Focussing on Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Vietnam and Australia, the four vignettes in this paper serve to highlight the intersections between Covid-19 and gendered burdens, particularly in frontline work, unpaid care work and community activities. While pre-disaster gender burdens are well established as strong, our analysis during the early months of the pandemic indicates that women's burdens are escalating. We estimate that women will endure a worsening of their burdens until the pandemic is well under control, and for a long time after. Public policy and health efforts have not sufficiently acknowledged the issues concerned with the associations between gender and disease outbreaks. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {At a time of acute housing crisis, hotels are increasingly being deployed to give temporary shelter to homeless families in wealthy cities. This paper explores the socio-political implications of the use of hotels for temporary accommodation, drawing on research conducted in Dublin. Specifically, we argue that the housing of homeless families in hotels exposes how they are made out of place in the city, even in the spaces allocated to house them. Hotels are spaces designed for the respite of others but, for homeless families, they conversely offer no relief and are even actively disruptive to their lives. The paper explores three ways in which hotels, presumed to provide restorative breaks from everyday routines, conversely act as points of rupture for homeless families. First, we consider how hotels are marketed as spaces where social reproductive work can be enjoyably put on hold. However, we argue that these perceived conveniences are experienced as disruptive for families forced to live in hotels for months, even years, at a time. Second, we explore the juxtaposition between the well-being and health benefits hotels are designed to offer guests and the devastating physical and mental health implications for homeless families living in hotels. Third, we compare how hotel management and marketing emphasise the importance of customer service as integral to a hotel's success, while simultaneously shaming and stigmatising homeless residents. The paper concludes by calling for greater attention to be paid to how hotels, normally considered sites of rest, become sites of rupture when used as temporary accommodation, exacerbating the stigmatisation and threats to well-being that homeless families suffer.

Objectives: This article aims to understand how traditional gender roles shift in couples in which the father stays at home, examining how these fathers and their partners relate to the respective roles of resource provider and family care provider, and more broadly to masculinity and femininity. Methodology: To this end, we build upon the results of a quantitative survey based on semi-directive interviewing, that was led in France among twenty-five fathers in heterosexual couples with children, who have not worked in at least the last six months. Results: Results suggest that stay-at-home fathers are in a hybrid position as pertains to gender norms: between transgression, with their adoption of a role that is perceived as feminine, and reaffirmation of their belonging to the masculine gender, through showcasing activities or roles that are characterized as masculine. Likewise, even though their feminine partners are assigned the resource purveyor role in these couples, they do not appear to forsake the caregiver role. Conclusions: These stay-at-home fathers seem to adjust their role, conciliating the role of caregiver and provider of resources, and privileging the more typical masculine aspects of a provider of care. Contribution: This exploratory study suggests that measures meant to more fully engage fathers by way of parental leave associated to early childhood may be efficient.},

Juxtaposing the social infrastructures that emerged from the practices of early unfree workers in the Caribbean with those produced by low income communities today, I trace continuities in the ways that people in situations of extreme precarity engage with space in order to exercise control over their labour.

The special case of Japan lies in the implication of local authorities in the promotion of these marriages, locating the matrimonial migratory route at the crossroads of familial migration and work migration from the point of view of both the migrants themselves and the host communities. Marriage migrants in Japan are one of the variations of the transfer of a feminine workforce to ensure reproductive work. While migratory policies in Japan have generally appealed to side doors for unqualified immigration, local authorities have helped create extra side doors via marriage to provide support in the context of the restructuring of reproductive work. Migrant wives also represent a potential salaried foreign workforce especially in peripheral zones which have difficulty attracting migrants. An analysis of the participation of these migrants in both reproductive and productive work (remunerated or not) enables us to better understand the contemporary debate that feminized migratory routes tend to reinforce patriarchal norms. © 2017 BCAS, Inc.},

With actions, ideas and affections forged in the daily routine of labor, the women strained -in subtle and diverse ways- what capital and some social mandates expected of them. © 2021 Seccion Historia.

In the post-1980s period and up to the present conjuncture, the political economy of the world has been increasingly characterized as a neoliberal capitalist economy. South Asian women’s work experiences in the diaspora is discussed in this chapter. The chapter draws on secondary literature from Canada, the USA and the UK. Diasporic South Asian women living with their families find themselves faced with a double day of work, fulfilling both paid and unpaid reproductive work of childcare, homemaking and ‘being the wife’. The chapter demonstrates that diasporic South Asian women have played a significant role as paid workers in the labour market and have been anything but ‘passive victims’. © 2018 selection and editorial material, Radha Sarma Hegde and Ajaya Kumar Sahoo.},

These views, which have become taken-for-granted explanations of what wages are, hide the underlying dynamics of the gender pay gap and place responsibility on individuals instead of gendered social structures. This article proposes viewing gender pay inequity through a sociological lens, which implies acknowledging the complex societal dynamics and roles of institutions and actors in shaping wages. The Nordic welfare states are often considered women-friendly, providing female citizens with social policies and services that have enabled their extensive participation in paid employment. Simultaneously, the Finnish welfare state has relied heavily on inexpensive labour provided by women, thus actively contributing to the formation of a secondary female-dominated labour market. The secondary status of reproductive work conducted within the public sector has been further strengthened and institutionalized by the Finnish corporatist system via collective agreements. In policy-making, the central actors defend their vested interests through non-decision-making, limiting the scope of decision-making to non-threatening issues. This article discusses the dynamics of the Finnish corporatist regime, welfare-state employment, and the impact of both on gender pay equity in Finnish society. © 2018 The Nordic Association for Women's Studies and Gender Research.},

	abstract = {My aim in this paper is to introduce a theory of affective labor as byproductive, a concept I develop through analysis of the phenomenology of various affective labor practices in dialog with feminist scholarship, both on gendered and racialized labor, and on affect and emotion. I motivate my theory in the context of literature on affective and emotional labor in philosophy and the social sciences, engaging the post-Marxist literature on affective and immaterial labor and emphasizing feminist critiques. I argue that affective labor is not only the work of producing affects for others to consume or the reproductive work that rejuvenates and sustains labor power and social life, but also the work of metabolizing waste affects and affective byproducts. Thus, byproductive labor is a neologism I develop to bring into view an affective economy and indeed a political economy of affects to the side of the distinction between productive and reproductive labor in its paid and unpaid variants. I make three central claims: (1) affective labor invariably creates byproducts in the embodied subjectivity of the worker; (2) the unique kind of affective expenditure I call “byproductive” (metabolizing affective surplus, containing affective waste, and producing depleted affective agency) is a defining feature of affective labor not circumscribed by the productive-reproductive distinction; and (3) the marginalized forms of subjectivity and depleted agency constituted through the intersections of this labor with hierarchies of gender, race, and migrant status or global class are themselves byproducts of affective labor. Thus, theorizing affective labor as byproductive captures the uniqueness of affective labor and the forms of exploitation unique to it, but also explains the interaction of affective labor with forms of power that operate through subjection and marginalization. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Work flooded home spaces and telecommuting was relocated to the center of the domestic realm. This qualitative research analyzes the experience of female academics working remotely during the pandemic in Chile. Through photo-elucidated interviews with a sample of 15 academics from universities from the north, center and south of Chile, the article addresses university-institutionalized gender neutrality as a structure that deepens inequalities and excludes academic women with caretaking responsibilities. The results show an intensification and extension of the online workday, an overload of reproductive work, simultaneity of tasks, emotional vulnerability and isolation. Yet, for some academics, remote work has also meant greater concentration and work flexibility. The various conditions profoundly affect the remote work experience and personal well-being of female academics, as well as their possibilities for knowledge production and scientific productivity. Given the diversity of realities for remote work during the health crisis, university policies on remote work with a gender perspective are urgently required. © 2021 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

We consider anonymity and altruism to be legal instruments that favor the private and privative appropriation of "donated" gametes in sufficient quantity for the development of the market and the reproductive industry.

While newly professionalized white medical men celebrated the work of their own hands in speeches and in published articles, the lives and work of enslaved women in these early clinical spaces were alternately effaced and re-imagined in support of dominant narratives of medical progress. Black women’s injuries, their suffering, their instances of endurance, and, indeed, their very bodies were made to testify to the prowess of their examining physicians. The black female test subjects who comprised the first cohorts subjected to the emergent gynecological technologies of the mid-19th-century labored under the condition of enslavement. Their value in the discursive and syntagmatic spaces of the case reports written about them during the latter decades of the century was, therefore, wrought through with the political economy of chattel slavery. This essay argues that the early clinical spaces created by the American medical men heralded as the founding fathers of American gynecology —including James Marion Sims and his colleague Nathan Bozeman—mark critical locations mapping slavery’s circuits of value production. Further, it troubles prevailing historiography of slavery and medicine by considering the repetitive representations of black women’s bodies as part of the reproductive work that they were called to do. © 2016 University of Illinois at Chicago.},

	abstract = {This article explores the involvement of doctors, men, and men’s partners in the clinical setting of male infertility in France and French-speaking Switzerland from the 1890s to the 1970s. Drawing from medical literature, press articles, media archives, and patient records, this paper questions the gendered construction of medical and patient work. It argues that in medical encounters, doctors, men, and men’s partners did not only engage with infertility but also with patients’ masculinities. The association between fertility and masculinity meant that men, but also doctors, were sometimes reluctant to explore the male factor of reproduction. Therefore, physicians elaborated specific strategies–such as referring to traits stereotypically associated with masculinity, attenuating fertility diagnoses or delegating information to men’s partners–to either include or dismiss men from the clinical setting, and to avoid harming their feelings of masculinity. In the meantime, women were made responsible for men’s reproductive health, reproducing a gendered division of reproductive work. This paper highlights partners’ work, such as consulting first, persuading their partners to undergo fertility exams, and mediating the relationship with physicians. © 2020 The Nordic Association for Research on Men and Masculinities.},

This time is expressed in both freely available time, which is related to activities, and time of the productive and reproductive sphere. This chapter considers work in a broad sense and takes into account the sexual division of labour. Specifically, this chapter will explore transformations in time use and social inequality in unpaid work. For this purpose, a comparative analysis of time-use surveys will be used, analysing the time spent, and the time dedicated to household chores in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Spain. From an analytical viewpoint, the analysis will place social reproduction at the centre of the socio-economic system, showing that the economic crisis has affected women and men differently, and that in both Europe and Latin America the family pattern is being replaced by a dominant family model of a male provider and a double presence of women. The large-scale incorporation of women into the labour market has emphasised the role that women assume in the domestic sphere perpetuating gender segregation in employment and in domestic and care work. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Women’s unpaid care and domestic work is gaining relevance in policy-making as well as in academia. Feminist scholars and activists have lobbied successfully for the integration of unpaid care and domestic work into the Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 5.4) of the United Nations in the hope for greater recognition of women’s contribution to the economy. Policy documents about social reproduction highlight women’s disproportionate share of reproductive activities as an obstacle to women’s economic empowerment and as a relic of ‘traditional’ gender roles. Social reproduction is thereby not understood as a merit in itself, but as an obstacle to women’s participation in paid labour. Policy implications will enable certain empowerment effects for some women, but at the same time promote the increasing privatization and commodification of reproductive work across the globe. Rising inequalities between the Global North and South and between women along the categories of class and race will be one major result. To theoretically explain such contradictory effects of the recognition of social reproduction, I use the concept of ‘enclosures’ based on Marx’ ‘primitive accumulation’. Feminist scholars use the concept to explain how unpaid care and housework is commodified or de-commodified to integrate women into the paid labour force or to reduce the costs of social reproduction according to the needs of the economy. The sudden interest in unpaid care and domestic work e.g. in the Sustainable Development Goals can therefore be seen as process of double enclosure, which integrates women into the paid labour force, but also sets the grounds for the further commodification of domestic and care work. This paper aims to critically discuss the sudden interest in unpaid domestic and care work and its contradictory effects from a Marxist feminist perspective and reflects on feminist strategies and movements in global governance. After introducing Marxist perspectives on social reproduction, the question if and how feminist ideas and concepts have been appropriated, the effects and implications of global policies on social reproduction and global inequalities, as well as possible counter-strategies will be discussed. © 2018, Unified Theory of Information Research Group.

However, welfare state has not developed strategies in order to assure the equal access to rights between men and women. Issues like reproductive work, subsidiarity from labour market, or the unequal degree of demercantilization have been subordinated to other topics. In this article, we try to analyse the genealogy of welfare state from a gender perspective. We study the criticisms introduced by feminist theories. In order to do this, we describe an historical approximation that bear in mind the perspectives that analyses the evolution of women vindication movements within the field of social welfare promotion. Furthermore, we present data related to the feminists’ approaches that endorses their arguments and discourses. Thus, these elements allow us to explore a reflection about the concept of expropriation of welfare. In this sense, those who have contributed to the supply of social care (mainly women) may have been devoid of protection, and that would be in favour of the promotion and improvement of welfare of those who have been protected from their position in the labour market.},

Drawing on ethnographic data, shortcomings in light of solo-self-employed, precarious, feminized work will be identified within the literature of emotional labour and interactive service work. In an attempt to overcome these shortcomings, I suggest the term “relationship work” in order to adequately research the invisible boundary work behind the actual service work. In so doing, I show how service workers face contradictory challenges in the process of commodifying gendered reproductive work such as beauty work. Furthermore, I discuss how beauticians negotiate and adjust the boundaries between reproductive and productive work that are integral to the capitalist organisation of work. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Among the innovations, the examination of reproductive struggles are highlighted, with a focus on the reordering developed from the perspective of the popular economy. Additionally, other approaches are noted which underline the connection between the work on the sustenance of life and the defense of the territory, the repolitization of misogynist violence, the critique of the idealization of the communal, and the reformulation of the principal of communality starting from reproduction and care.

	abstract = {Research Framework: In both France and Germany, reproduction law is often presented as structured around freedom, autonomy and choice based paradigms. While it is undeniable that the law now allows individuals, especially women, to make reproductive choices, the fact remains that it further encourages some reproductive choices at the expense of others. The way in which the law frames the reproductive choices of individuals tells us something about the model of the “ideal” family that is put forward by the state. While this model differs somewhat between legal orders depending on the social, historical, cultural or political context in France and Germany, it includes, however, a number of similarities, notably in that it perpetuates a gender order structured around the normalized distinction between “reproductive work” (traditionally attributed to women) and “productive work” (traditionally reserved for men). Objectives: This research analyzes the way reproductive law constructs an ideal model of kinship by promoting some reproductive choices and encouraging the founding of some types of families. This article aims to deconstruct the narrative surrounding the legal framework of reproduction that is understood as an autonomous choice, which allows women to refuse motherhood in a logic of maternal “over power” that creates inequalities for men. Methodology: We analyzed the legal framework (legal texts and case law), mainly regulating birth control, childbirth under X, abortion, medically assisted procreation, but also the establishment of filiation (parentage). Results: Our research has shown that the law encourages the constitution of the “genetic” family, which is assumed to be heteronormative, and can be apprehended in a differentiated way between motherhood and fatherhood. Conclusions: As the law standardizes behaviours, it “normalizes” individual choices that are not always considered as legitimized. The rules governing authorized procreation techniques in France and Germany are no exception to this principle. Although reproduction law authorizes birth control, anonymous delivery, abortion or medically assisted reproduction in both countries, it remains reluctant to accept the refusal of motherhood (more than the refusal of fatherhood) and instead encourages the founding of a heterosexual family in contrast to a non-heterosexual family. Contribution: Our research highlights the fundamental role of the law in legitimizing some parental projects or families. © 2021 Centre - Urbanisation Culture Societe de l'INRS.

	abstract = {Although highly recognized as needed, studies linking gender and coastal/marine management are scarce. This research illustrates the importance of gender analysis in natural resource management by linking gender and coastal management i.e. Marine Spatial Planning. The research was conducted in various Zanzibar seascapes (Unguja Island, Tanzania). Using a typology comprising gender structure, symbolism and identity; the results show a clear gendered division of labor, highly associated with a gender symbolism in which traditional roles of women as responsible for reproduction activities played a major role. Men used the whole seascape for their activities, while women remained in coastal forests and shallow areas collecting wood, invertebrates and farming seaweed. These activities allowed women to combine productive and reproductive work. Ecosystem importance for subsistence decreased with distance from land for both genders, while the importance for income increased with distance for men. Both genders acknowledged seagrasses as very important for income. Income closely followed the universal pattern of men earning more. Identities were defined by traditional ideas like “women are housewives”, while men identities were strongly associated with fisheries with reinforced masculinity. Livelihood diversity was higher for women also showing a tendency of slow change into other roles. Management was found to be strongly androcentric, revealing a deep gender inequality. The research exemplifies how a gender analysis can be conducted for management enhancement. It also invites replication around the world. If management is found to be androcentric in coastal locations elsewhere, a serious gender inequality can be at hand at global level. © 2017 The Authors},

However, very few empirical studies provide evidence to support these concerns. This paper examines the relationship between women's time spent in domestic work and agriculture and women's and children's dietary diversity. Using data from Bangladesh, Nepal, Cambodia, Ghana, and Mozambique, we find that women's domestic work and cooking time are positively correlated with more diverse diets. We also find differential effects depending on asset poverty status. In Mozambique, working long hours in agriculture is negatively associated with women's dietary diversity score in nonpoor women, but is positively associated with poor women's dietary diversity and poor children's minimum acceptable diet. This suggests that agriculture as a source of food and income is particularly important for the asset poor. Our results reveal that women's time allocation and nutrition responses to agricultural interventions are likely to vary by socioeconomic status and local context. © 2018 The Authors},

Although many studies have addressed the social dimension of space in cities, there nevertheless remains a lack of theory relating to the production of space through the oppression and privilege associated, with or caused by, the relations of social reproduction. With the aim of helping to fill this gap, the spatiality of unpaid reproductive work was studied through intersectional analysis. This was done by exploring the spatial practice of the temporary load of unpaid reproductive work as an element responsible for inequality and by relating this to the dimensions of: 1) space and time, and 2) class, sex and age. This intersectional approach allowed us to analyse inequalities in social reproduction and identify spaces of privilege and spaces of oppression in terms of unpaid reproductive work. The study focused on the Balearic Islands and used the latest Time Use Survey (TUS) available in Spain. It is a dialogue between critical urban geography, urban sociology and feminist theory, which makes it possible to visualise the power relations and urban inequality that have derived from the sexual division of labour within the logic of historical capitalism. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde zu Berlin.

This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the views and experiences of employees, and the key drivers of infection control and personal biosecurity (PB) practices in the Thoroughbred breeding industry. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted in 2018 in New South Wales, Australia using interviews (9) and small group discussions (7). The 29 participants included veterinarians, veterinary nurses, foaling staff, stud managers and laboratory personnel working in a range of equine medicine settings. Interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed and analysed manually by at least two members of the research team. An iterative approach was used to derive themes. Results: Five main themes emerged: (i) greater awareness of current and emerging infectious risks promotes use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE); (ii) currently available PPE is not comfortable, practical or well-suited to equine reproductive work in Australia's hot climate; (iii) creating supportive environments for PB reduces risk of exposure to infectious materials; (iv) strong leadership is required to implement sustainable change in workplace culture and practices; and (v) policy and economic factors play an important role in adopting biosecurity (BS) and PB measures in the workplace. Personnel working in the Australian Thoroughbred breeding industry face unique zoonotic risks in a challenging physical environment. A qualitative approach provided rich insights into social and physical factors motivating BS and PB in this occupational group. There is an opportunity for collaboration between Public Health services and industry partners to develop and implement strategies most likely to be effective in ensuring consistent uptake of PB measures in the workplace. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

It focuses on a recent decision by a court in South Africa (Nkala and Others v. Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited and Others, 2016) that took the unusual step of acknowledging this care work and attempting to compensate it indirectly. The article combines insights from political economy and law within a feminist frame to develop an argument about compensation for social reproductive work to address the harm experienced by the carers of mineworkers. Using the theory of depletion through social reproduction, it suggests ways of understanding the costs of care in order to fully compensate the harms suffered by the carers. This is done with reference to a photographic essay by Thom Pierce called ‘The Price of Gold’ taken in the mineworkers’ homes after their discharge from work due to illness. The article argues that ideas of depletion should inform any consideration of compensation of people engaged in caring in a range of reparatory contexts. © The Author(s) 2017.},

The paper is based on the analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with two ethnic Hungarian women whose lives have been significantly reshaped by cross-border migration. Focusing on the interplay of gender and cross-border migration, our aim is to reveal how gender roles and boundaries are reinforced and repositioned by labour migration in the post-socialist context where both the socialist dual-earner model and conventional ideas of family and gender roles simultaneously prevail. We found that cross-border migration challenged these women to pursue diverse strategies to balance their roles of breadwinner, wife, and mother responsible for reproductive work. Nevertheless, the boundaries between female and male work or status were neither discursively nor in practice transgressed. Thus, the effect of cross-border migration on altering gender boundaries in post-socialist peripheries is limited. Copyright © 2020 MIGRATION LETTERS},

I argue that any caregiver program should see caregivers - irrespective of their national or foreign origin - as fully contributory members of society and thereby entitled to an extensive range of citizenship rights and entitlements. While this proposal is not completely novel, what I offer through this article is a regulatory justification for migrant caregivers' claim to full socio-economic citizenship rights and entitlements. I develop this justification by drawing on - and reconceptualizing - the economic productivity-focused social reproduction perspective. In this article, then, I make two points: first, I propose a theoretical reconceptualization of socially reproductive work and, second, by evaluating migrant care workers' status in Canada, I argue that on the basis of social reciprocity, caregivers cannot be considered temporary insofar as their entitlements are concerned. © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.},

	abstract = {The contribution of feminism, as a critique of social inequalities and as a complex way to challenge neoliberalism and patriarchy, has been crucial in Chile – especially in the last few years. Various events have been particularly relevant: the plight of those seeking free, safe abortion; the feminist revolution of May 2018; and the performance by ‘Las Tesis’, as well as the expressions of other feminist organisations during the Chilean revolt in October 2019 (18-O). These events have been part of a key step in Chile: the process of changing Pinochet's Constitution. This process of change will have a commission with gender parity: for the first time in the world, the Constitution will be written equally by men and women. How feminist principles are incorporated in the new Magna Carta will be very important. By ‘feminist principles’ we mean, among other things, the recognition of different identities and rights–such as reproductive rights or reproductive work–that have remained historically hidden, and this denial has contributed to deepened inequalities. We will analyse this process using feminist perspectives and tools such as redistribution, which defends and favours a more just distribution of resources and wealth; recognition of different groups; and intersectionality, incorporating interconnected systems of discrimination and oppression. Another contribution in this revolutionary process is, following Butler, the invitation to consider vulnerability, not as a purely passive position that yields the site of agency to different forms of paternalism, but rather as the condition of possibility of resistance. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Even as it highlights the importance of labour rights for all, it also makes visible some significant tensions. We note, for example, that despite many critiques of narrow economic measures of growth, the focus here remains on GDP and per capita growth. This is problematic, we argue, because the GDP productive boundary excludes much of social reproductive work. This puts SDG8 in tension with SDG 5 which calls for the recognition of the value of unpaid care and domestic work. There has been a significant increase in the rate of working women in the formal and informal sector. However, there has not been a subsequent gender shift in the doing of social reproductive work. In this paper we argue SDG 8's focus on decent work and economic growth is inadequate; that productive employment and decent work for all men and women by 2030 needs to take into account the value and costs of social reproduction. We trace key historical debates on work to argue that both gender and labour rights have to underpin SDG 8 if its promise of inclusive, sustainable and decent work is to be realized. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Integrating discourses on faculty contingency and diversity with care scholarship reveals that the construction of a casualized and predominantly female teaching class in higher education follows longstanding patterns of devaluing socially reproductive work under capitalism. The devaluation of care may also have a disparate impact on the advancement of women within the tenure system. In short, academic labor issues are also diversity issues. To re-value those who care, intersectional alliances must be forged not only between faculty sectors, but also among faculty, care workers in other industries, and members of society who benefit from caring labor. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {This article ties in with existing discussions on global care chains, family separation and the devaluation of social-reproductive work. We explore the new trend of outsourcing care for the elderly to countries with lower wages. We base our analysis on the debate in the German press and supplement it with insights from ethnographic field observations in two care homes in Thailand. We identify a discourse of abandonment, which shows how outsourcing the care of the elderly unsettles the privilege of sedentarism that is often taken for granted in the Global North. Furthermore, the newspaper articles tend to villainize people who seek care for their loved ones abroad. We argue that both discourses foster a neoliberal rationale of individualized responsibility and obfuscate the deep systemic roots of the care crisis in the Global North. However, by extending the discussion on outsourcing care for the elderly beyond the dominant media discourses, we envisage a rich potential for provoking political debate on the revaluation of care. © 2019 Global Networks Partnership & John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

We explicate the legal framework underpinning exclusive breastfeeding and maternity leave, and identify significant gaps between labour and exclusive breastfeeding legislation and the implementation of these laws in workplaces and universities. The tensions between the gendered expectations of women's contributions to reproductive and productive work are also exposed.

Within the frameworks of classical and neoclassical economic theories, the regulatory power of the market also shapes micro-level relations and the division of labour within the household and firms. In the traditional gendered division of labour, households, and especially mothers, hold the responsibility of fulfilling unpaid social-reproductive work. Sexual harassment and violence against women are another manifestation of discrimination against women in the workplace. The division of paid and unpaid work between men and women, and the quality of work, wages and benefits are critical for the welfare of most Latin Americans and play a key role in human development and equality goals for the region by gender, race, and class.

	abstract = {Since 1990, papers presented at successive women/gender and fisheries conferences of the Asian Fisheries Society have followed a pathway trodden by other fields of gender research. Starting with noticing androcentrism in fisheries, the conferences proceeded to noticing the omissions and adding depth of detail on women’s roles and their contributions. Adding gender perspectives then helped to identify politicized policy and power structures and recognize the importance of accounting for intersectionality, as well as propose transformation. Historically, this work is rooted in the broader scholarship on gender and fisheries, in which the positions of women are dictated by the prevailing political economy of fisheries, itself embedded in the global political economy. Despite the greater insights, the position of women has changed little. The time is therefore ripe for gender and fisheries researchers to broaden their horizons and develop a feminist fisheries political economy agenda to better support activism for gender equal fisheries. A foundation for such work has already been laid in fisheries from the gender studies and activism of fisheries restructuring under globalization. The global feminist political economy project also has paved the way. The global project can be adapted to guide three major fisheries research areas. The first is understanding the gendered structures in fisheries economies as embedded in the gendered global economy. The second key is specifically assessing fisheries economic policies and practices using the lens of women’s rights in the fish value chain, from production inputs to rights of access to fish and fishing, and to women’s position in post-harvest processing and marketing. The third is examining the unpaid and household economy in which a great deal of women’s fisheries and reproductive work in the household and community is done. As the new research agenda and its link to activism may not be embraced by some mainstream agencies already studying gender and fisheries, do we need to create feminist fisheries political economy think tanks with greater flexibility? © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Objectives To analyse the association between the type of work (productive vs reproductive work) and the levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in women with fibromyalgia. Method This cross-sectional study involved 258 women with fibromyalgia from southern Spain. Of them, 55% performed reproductive work (unpaid, associated with caregiving and domestic roles) exclusively, while 45% had productive job (remunerated, that results in goods or services). Physical activity of light, moderate and vigorous intensity in the leisure time, at home, at work, and totally were measured through the leisure time physical activity instrument and with the physical activity at home and work instrument, respectively. Sedentary behaviour was measured by the Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire. Results After adjusting for age, fat percentage, education level and marital status, the multivariate analysis of covariance model informed the existence of significant differences between type of work groups (p<0.001). Women with productive work engaged in more light physical activity at work (mean difference =448.52 min; 95 % CI 179.66 to 717.38; p=0.001), and total physical activity of light (809.72 min; 535.91 to 1085.53; p<0.001) and moderate (299.78 min; 97.31 to 502.25; p=0.004) intensity. Women with reproductive work engaged in more light physical activity at home (379.14; 175.64 to 582.64; p<0.001). Leisure time physical activity and sedentary behaviour were similar in both groups (p>0.05 for all comparisons). Conclusions Women with productive work had greater levels of physical activity compared with those who only did reproductive work, except for physical activity at home. Having productive work might facilitate movement of women with fibromyalgia towards a more active lifestyle. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.},

	abstract = {Women’s equality and freedom of choice have become identified with modernism and oppressive patriarchy with traditionalism because greater societal differentiation and complexity increase the individualism and autonomy of women. Since 1970 a unified, if still largely implicit, sociological theory of women’s equality has emerged. Social scientists have argued that societies vary in gender equality because of key elements in their social structures. Beginning around 1970, however, scholars who were studying women’s actual experience in development discovered a more complex pattern than the rising line of gradual progress that had been implied by classical sociological theory. Women’s roles in production were very important in family farming systems such as those found in West Africa, Oceania, or Central and South America, whereas their roles were fairly limited in the male farming systems of China or India. Women’s empowerment presumably results in a reordering of rewards to give relatively more compensation and value to reproductive work. © 1992 by Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The fishing family often lives in very poor conditions without basic amenities. To overcome the problem of poverty in the fishing family, there is a need for full participation and involvement from both men and women in the family. The facts indicate that persistent poverty has forced many women to do the productive work while at the same time continuing to perform reproductive work. The burden of crises often falls on the shoulders of women in fishery households. Nevertheless, the time spent by women doing productive work is rarely considered as a strategic contribution. The role of women often goes unrecognized and unacknowledged in economic and cultural terms. Moreover, women generally have limited access and control over resources, which will lead to gender inequality. Unequal relationships between women and men will affect women's opportunities to participate and to benefit from development interventions. The present study was conducted to highlight gender division of work, time allocation, and the access and control over family assets and resources in Korong Pasir Baru, Padang Pariaman District, West Sumatra, Indonesia. The results revealed that the time spent by men and women on reproductive, productive, and social activities and their access to family assets are equal for both men and women. However, there is a difference in terms of access to control over resources and decision making, which is biased toward men. The research also identified family characteristics, sociocultural factors, religious factors, educational factors, and the formal legal system to be influencing factors in access to and control of resources in the area. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Second, we explore the limitations of cash transfer welfare programmes by examining their failure to address the needs of children who provide care within the family and show how misperceptions by social policymakers of the experiences of young carers limit the capacity of social policies to make a difference to their well-being.

It shows the results of retrospective interviews to young women that have rebuild the full transition road from high school to the work world or the care sector.

They seek more dignity in a sector marked by inequality and exploitation. In addition, the unions have developed collective strategies for the implementation of Law n.150/2015, which guarantees labor rights for domestic workers, in keeping with the ILO's "decent work" discourse and their partnerships with other social movements.

A reformulation of the category of (re)productivity - the idea of the unity of and at the same time the distinction between production and reproduction in the economic process - could set the stage for us to review today's crisis phenomena, relocalize problems, and in this way to develop new solutions for them.

	abstract = {The identification and valorization of unacknowledged, feminized forms of economic productivity has been an important task for feminist theory. In this article, we expand and rethink existing definitions of labour, in order to recognize the essential economic role women play in the stem cell and regenerative medicine industries, new fields of biomedical research that are rapidly expanding throughout the world. Women constitute the primary tissue donors in the new stem cell industries, which require high volumes of human embryos, oöcytes, foetal tissue and umbilical cord blood. Such material is generally given for free in the advanced industrial democracies, constituted as a surplus ('spare' embryos) or waste (umbilical cord 'afterbirth', cadaveric foetuses, poor quality oöcytes) whose generative powers should not be withheld from others. At the same time, among impoverished female populations in developing nations, such biological material is now often procured through frankly transactional relations, where women undertake risky procedures for small fees. In each case, female bodily productivity is mobilized to support bioeconomic research, yet the economic value involved in these relations is largely unacknowledged. In this article, we consider both the gift economy and the transactional economy for reproductive tissues as a form of labour. In order to fully conceptualize the specificities of feminized productivity in the bioeconomy, we distinguish between earlier feminist theories of reproductive labour and the emerging practices generated by stem cell research, which we term regenerative labour. We consider how historical transformations in the regulation of feminized labour and the technical repertoires of stem cell research renegotiate the productivity limits of female reproductive biology, opening it out to novel and profitable forms of surplus value and enrolling women in complex negotiations over their role in bioeconomic activity. © The Author(s), 2010.},

	abstract = {Surveillance of children and young people in non–Western contexts has received little attention in the literature. In this paper we draw principally on our research in one African country, Malawi, to examine the ways in which their independent travel is shaped by(usually adult–directed) surveillance and control in diverse urban and rural contexts. Surveillance is interpreted very broadly, because our empirical data indicates a range of practices whereby a close watch is kept over children as they move around their community and travel out to other locations. In some cases we suggest that surveillance of children and young people becomes internalized self–surveillance, such that no external social control is required to police their movements. Our evidence, from eight research sites, brings together a wide range of source material, including findings from intensive qualitative research with children and adults (in–depth interviews, accompanied walks, focus groups, life histories) and a follow– up questionnaire survey administered to children aged 7–18 years [N=1,003]. Although many of the children in our study attend school, local economic circumstances in both urban and rural areas of Malawi commonly require children’s participation from an early age in a much broader range of productive and reproductive work activities than is usual in Western contexts, with corresponding impact on daily patterns of movement. Children may have to travel substantial distances for school, in support of family livelihoods, and for other purposes (including social events): the necessity for independent travel is common, and frequently raises concerns among parents and other adults in their communities such that surveillance is considered essential. This is achieved principally by encouraging travel in groups of children. We show how young people’s independent travel is mediated by (urban and rural) locational context, time of day, age and, in particular, by gender, and how adult efforts at surveillance may help shape resistances in the interstitial spaces which mobility itself provides. © The authors, 2011.},

	abstract = {India, facing a growing economy on the one hand and enormous poverty of its population on the other, has developed several policies on biofuels since 2002. The Indian state promotes projects on plants such as Jatropha for biodiesel. In these policies, mitigation of climate change is only one aim of the Indian state. Supply with Indian-made fuel is supposed to enhance economic growth, air pollution should be diminished and poor rural women should be given income opportunities. The national policy for biodiesel from 2008 states that till 2017 20% of the diesel used in India should come from plants, grown and transesterized in India. Enormous efforts from the Indian states and private companies will be necessary. The resources needed for this kind of production - land, water and human work - are limited. NGOs as well as state institutions debate whether the production and use of biofuel can ever be sustainable. The contested policies on biofuel in India are therefore one example of debates on sustainability and the underlying values and ideas about a satisfying livelihood for the Indian people. From a feminist-environmentalist perspective the questions to be asked are not only in which ways men and women are effected differently by, for example, Jatropha plantations. Rather it is important to ask in what ways sustainability is conceptualized and how nature as well as gender features in these concepts. The way we think about material resources such as land, water and human resources, e.g. female reproductive work, show some parallels. Both kinds of resources are seldom thought of as valuable just because they sustain human life, but rather, only if and when they can be monetarized as commodity. In order to figure out ways to provide sustainable livelihoods for everyone, we need to change the way nature and gender are conceptualized in strategies to cope with the ecological crisis. This includes a change of ethics towards a focus on what is necessary for the 'Good Life'. The paper will analyze the concepts of sustainability in Indian biofuel policies from a feminist-environmentalist perspective as well as show an alternative way of thinking about ecology and gender. © 2012 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

It examines the ways in which these Utopias have envisaged cultural labour - whether as specialist artistic occupations or as a general creative dimension of all labour - and relates this to the gender divisions of labour envisaged for these idealized societies. It concludes that most Utopias fail to imagine future changes in the social division between paid and unpaid work. Where these have gone beyond a model of small self-sufficient agrarian communities, even if they have envisaged changes in the technical division of labour, they have reproduced existing gender divisions of labour, excluding unpaid reproductive work from their visions of emancipation and work-sharing. In so doing, they have constructed cultural labour as something which is supported invisibly by the reproductive labour of others. © 2015 The Editorial Board of The Sociological Review.},

The migration experience of young women has brought few significant changes when they return to their communities. In sum, the daily activities of both women who migrate and reintegrated as those who stay are far beyond the borders of traditionally defined housework. Many of these activities are considered for social production but as they move into the female domain, they lose their value and are assumed to be new reproductive work.},

	abstract = {Background: The studies on women, gender and health are increasingly more frequent in Spain. This research is aimed at ascertaining the topics dealt with in these publications, the disciplines studying said topics, the sex of the leading author and whether these topics have been approached from a gender-related standpoint. Methods: A search was conducted for published studies in Biomedicine, Sociology, Nursing, Anthropology and Psychology databases. The main key words used were [women or gender] and [health] and [Spain]. Original articles, reviews and monographic studies, both national and international, published within the 1990-2005 period were included. The variables taken into consideration were the topic of study, field of expertise, gender focus and sex of those publishing the work. A total of 298 works were included. Results: The topics dealt with the most were sexual and reproductive health (39.2%) and mental health (12.4%). A total of 58.7% of the works were authored by a woman as the leading author and 47.3% had no gender focus. A total of 85.3% of the publications on sexual and reproductive health do not incorporate the gender standpoint, whilst 94.1% of the works on productive and reproductive work did however include this standpoint. A total of 80.4% of the works in Biomedicine have no gender focus. Conclusions: Even though they are scarce, the works having a gender focus are signed mostly by women as the leading authors. In the material studied, women's health continues to be confined to reproduction, it being necessary for other factors having a direct bearing on women's health to be included.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The chapter analyzes the conciliation strategies of the Chinese business families in Spain. Methodology - The data was gathered as part of a major fieldwork project that included in-depth interviews and participant observation. Findings - The research reveals a kind of transnational motherhood, which is invisible in the academic field. The strategy for work-family balance of the Chinese in Spain situates the mothers primarily in their productive dimension. Management of the work-family balance (the productive and reproductive work) depends on the phase of the family business path. Chinese families enact two different strategies for balancing work-family life: "transnationalized" reproduction and "externalized" reproduction. In both strategies, Chinese women do not engage in intensive motherhood, but at the same time they do remain highly involved in the home. The analysis of the productive-reproductive continuum shows the complexity of the gender relationships within the Chinese family enterprise. Theoretical implications - Fieldwork data discloses a dynamic social relationship and suggest a revision of the theoretical assumptions used to explain the links among gender, work, and family in transnational space. Practical implications - As global immigration continues to grow, adjustments and flexibility will be required of all parties. Immigrant families will have to contend with family reunification policies that vary from nation to nation. Because immigrant family dynamics can be culture-specific, receiving nations will require flexible policies in housing, education, and other sectors.

	abstract = {By examining household gender relations between migrant women and their left-behind husbands, we aim to understand how gender shapes rural-urban migration and is being negotiated in the context of market-driven rural transformations in the Red River Delta. In this study, rural women ensure the survival of their households as they link up with urban informal labour markets, moving to the city to work as junk collectors and buyers. Female migration destabilises conventional gender roles as left-behind husbands take up social reproductive work that is partially relieved by wives' frequent home visits. Additionally, invoking women's traditional obligations, left-behind husbands continue to 'feel like men', underscoring the resilience of conventional gendered norms on work, even where men actually take up women's work in their wives' absence. The article argues for a more nuanced understanding of this resilience premised on the principles of structured agency, suggesting that actors may actively reproduce gendered notions of work in order to cope with changing spatial arrangements of household livelihood strategies brought about by political economic pressures and opportunities in rural and urban Vietnam.

(a) It looks at how accumulation under post-colonial capitalism tends to blur various geopolitical boundaries of space, institutions, forms, financial regimes, labour processes, and economic segments on the one hand and creates zones and corridors on the other. In this context, it draws our attention to the peculiar but structurally necessary coexistence of both primitive and virtual modes of accumulation in the postcolony. With increasing inflow of virtual capital in the form of offshore funds, venture business, hedge funds, Internet-based investment and banking, and forward trading, more people are forced to accept precarious work conditions in the unorganized sectors resulting in massive de-peasantization and creation of footloose labour, otherwise known as migrant or transit labour. (b) At the same time, family household becomes the new site of capitalist production and market system, which is different from what is assumed to be a site of non-capitalist production, something that is outside of capital. (c) The introduction also draws attention to what is now called affective labour that is to say labour actualized in the forms of care work and reproductive work. Affective labour leads to the conceptualization of affective value by focusing on the labouring body and subjectivity. Affective value is often mistaken to be essentially a cultural category, and not an economic category, in spite of its vulnerability to exploitation, thus becoming an element in the dynamics of capitalist accumulation. These three aspects taken together reflect on one of the principal features postcolonial capitalism, namely the overwhelming existence of informal conditions of production. These new forms of accumulation result in new discursive and political terrains of struggle. The chapters of the volume reflect from different discursive, analytical, and conceptual perspectives on these new forms of accumulation and unique modes of struggle. © Mahanirban Calcutta Research Group (MCRG) 2017.},

	abstract = {Background: Gender inequalities in health have been largely documen-ted. The main objective of this study is to assess whether there are gender dif-ferences in perceived health and health services utilization, and their relation with double workload in a representative sample of immigrants and Murcian natives. Methods: We used data from the NHS 2006 and Health and Culture Study, 1,303 immigrants and 1,303 Spanish, both residents in the Region of Murcia. With the combinationof reproductive work and paid work webuilt up the variable 'double workload' (DW). We estimated the prevalence ratio (PR) for positive self-perceived health, chronic morbidity, activity limitation, doc-tor's visits, hospitalization, emergency and drug use, by origin, using regres-sion methods. Two models were constructed by adding double burden to the basic model adjusted by sociodemographic variables. Analyses were perfor-med between and within sex. Results: After adjusting for DW, no changes were seen in the differences by gender [RP women/men of positive perception health: 0.70 (0.54-0.89) East European; 0.87 (0.79-0.95) autochthonous / chronic morbidity: 1.44 (1.14-1.82) Hispanic; 1.36 (1.19-1.55) autochthonous / activity limitation: 2.23 (1.29-3.83) Hispanic; 1.45 (1.01-2.10) autochthonous / doctor's visits: 1.93 (1.50-2.48) Hispanic; 1.74 (1.06-2.86) Moroccan; 1.32 (1.09-1.59) autochthonous / hospitalization: 1.80 (1.02-3.17) Hispanic], almost the same than unadjusted. Women used more drugs than men. Within sexes, both autochthonous men (1.19; 1.06-1.33) and women (1.18; 1.01-1.40) with sha-red DW had more positive self-perceived health than those without DW. His-panic men with DW without assistance: 0.67 (0.47-0.94). Conclusions: Women have worse health indicators and greater use of health services regardless of origin. Consideration of the double workload does not explain gender inequalities in health.},

It attempts to inspect how a woman's body (fertility) and her labor has been the site or location from which the economic growth of the country was dependent on but has never been recognized. The paper examines women's contribution in the economy and their contribution to the economic growth of Malaysia. These contributions and changes were plotted against the changes in the policy domain with a focus on the New Economic Policy (NEP) and the New Population Policy (NPP) to see if there was any relationship between them. The paper also discusses that women have not always responded in line with policy calls especially in relation to their fertility but they have contributed significantly in the structural changes of the Malaysian economy. These responses are examined as a form of gender struggle within a fragmented and contradictory policy domain and within the context of very little gender equity/equality concerns in society and the policy domain. How these responses contributed in real terms to economic development and the overall growth of the country but with insignificant distributive effect for women contrary to the New Economic Policy's claim is critically analyzed in this paper.},

Poverty reduction policies that were based on the overly simplistic assumption that expanding economic growth would reduce poverty have not always proved to be correct (KIT Factsheet, 2007). From an estimated one billion people that live on less than US$1 a day (UNDP, 2003), 70 per cent are women (Barrientos, 2002: 1). On top of that, female earnings are approximately 70 to 80 per cent that of male earnings in both developed and developing countries. Only 20 per cent of this difference can be explained by conventional economic variables such as educational attainment, work experience, and job characteristics (Kabeer, 2003). According to Oxfam (2004) this is one of the glaring failures of the current economic model. Millions of women in paid employment contribute significantly to national economic growth, but their jobs do not provide the income, security, and support to lift them and their families out of poverty (Oxfam, 2004: 2). To avoid undermining women’s livelihoods, there is a crucial need to recognize women’s contribution to the economy through both their productive as well as reproductive work (Randriamaro, 2006). © 2012, Noortje Verhart and Rhiannon Pyburn.},

Yet, the informal economy, which so many urban dwellers and workers in low- and middle-income countries depend upon, is seldom considered. This paper examines the opportunities and barriers that the urban informal economy pose for making economies greener, and the risks that such attempts pose for vulnerable informal dwellers and workers. In contemplating how this group can be included in the transition to a greener economy, the different schools of thought on informality are reviewed, with a focus on recent thinking that relates urban informality to conflicting processes of inclusion and exclusion. The paper then considers a set of action areas aimed at leveraging the positive contributions that informal dwellers and workers can make in the transition to an economy that is not only greener, but also more inclusive. Leveraging these contributions will require recognising and supporting women's unpaid reproductive work (including community organising and strategizing around environmental improvements) and applying the principles of inclusive urban planning. © 2015 International Institute for Environment and Development.},

This paper aims to review the progressive incorporation of gender perspective and sex differences into health surveys in Spain, and to suggest design, data collection and analytical proposals as well as to make policy proposals. Methods: Changes introduced into health surveys in Spain since 1995 to incorporate gender perspective are examined, and proposals for the future are made, which would permit the analysis of differences in health between women and men as a result of biology or because of gender inequalities. Results: The introduction of gender perspective in health surveys requires the incorporation of questions related to family setting and reproductive work, workplace and society in general to detect gender differences and inequalities (for example, domestic work, intimate partner violence, discrimination, contract type or working hours). Health indicators reflecting differential morbidity and taking into account the different lifecycle stages must also be incorporated. Analyses ought to be disaggregated by sex and interpretation of results must consider the complex theoretical frameworks explaining the differences in health between men and women based on sex differences and those related to gender. Conclusions: Analysis of survey data ought to consider the impact of social, political and cultural constructs of each society. Any significant modification in procedures for collection of data relevant to the study of gender will require systematic coordination between institutions generating the data and researchers who are trained in and sensitive to the topic.},

	abstract = {Objective: To analyze the Spanish National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from a gender perspective, with special emphasis on gender division of labor. Method: We analyzed the 2003 Spanish NHIS from the p erspective of the levels of gender observation, with gender understood as: a) the basis of social norms (responsibilities by sex, health risks, and problems related to masculine/feminine roles); b) the organizer of the social structure: gender division of labor, work overload, vertical/horizontal segregation, time spent in activities according to social times, access to resources), and c) a component of individual identity (conflicts due to multiple roles, body image dissatisfaction, self-esteem, self-perceived recognition of the work performed, assimilation of the sexual gender role, sex differences in health conditions). Results: The Spanish NHIS is centered on the main provider, referred to in masculine grammatical form. Gender division of domestic labor is identified only by a general question. When using the concept of main activity for productive or reproductive work, the survey requires respondents to evaluate them and select only one, thus losing information and hampering analysis of the impact of an overload of work on health. Information on time used for reproductive work and leisure is not solicited. Assaults (intentional) and accidents (non-intentional) are combined in the same question, thus preventing research on gender-related violence. Conclusions: The Spanish NHIS includes the var iable of sex, but its more descriptive than analytic focus limits gender analysis. The survey allows specific circumstances of employment-related inequalities between sexes to be measured, but does not completely allow other indicators of gender inequalities, such as the situation of housewives or work overload, to be measured.},

The resulting information offers a rich panorama that can be analyzed together with other data sources provided by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics/IBGE) in order to outline the process of deconstruction of traditional gender identities. In this sense, perceptions about the roles of family, state and market in the possible arrangements under discussion vary greatly depending on the respondent's profile. Generally speaking, it highlights the fact that historically important variables such as educational level have a modified importance because of the increasing complexity of ongoing dynamics in recent years. © 2016, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

As a collection, the articles emphasise the complexity of trying to define what work-life balance means to different groups of men and women in three locales (Bristol, West London and Dublin), highlighting that trying to attribute meaning to this concept is at the very least problematic. They do, however, paint a picture of persistent gendered inequality. Within the context of neo-liberal economic policy 'encouraging' women to take up paid work and training, it is still women rather than men who continue to be responsible for the tasks of social reproduction. The concept of work-life balance ignores the often blurred and ultimately socially constructed nature of what counts as work and what does not and tends to mask the large amount of reproductive work performed by women in the private sphere. Moreover, the research presented here makes clear that contours of power and powerful relations run through the conceptualisation of work-life balance as well as its practice and promotion by government, organisations and individuals. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {The identification and measurement of the population health needs should be the first step in health planning. In order to guarantee equity criteria, to know the situation of the whole population, and therefore also that of women, is a key issue. Health interview surveys are a good tool for pinpointing the needs of the population, but mainly they are usually focused on health risk factors that explain men's health status such as health behaviours and paid job. These factors often fail to capture aspects that are relevant for women's health, such as household work. The main objective of this paper is to emphasise the importance of a gender perspective in the design and analysis of health interview surveys, and to propose variables that should be included in health surveys in order to better know gender health inequalities. Likewise, this article deals with the gender concept and its importance as a health inequality factor. Gender is an analytical construct based on the social organisation of the sexes that can be used to better understand the conditions and factors influencing women's and men's health beginning by the social roles that each culture and society assigns to people based on their sex. Health is a complex process determined by a wide range of factors: biological, social, environmental and health services related factors. Gender, because of its close relation to all of them, plays a key role. The gender approach is characterised by the analysis of the social relation between men and women, taking into account that sex is a determinant of social inequalities. This paper presents the variables that health interview surveys should include from a gender approach point of view: reproductive work, productive work, social class, social support, self-perceived health status, quality of life, mental health and chronic conditions. In addition, issues related to the wording of questions, data collection and analysis are discussed.},

These practices themselves overlap in terms of their material forms, bodily and mental activities with the practices undertaken by labour employed to produce the built environment within the capitalist marketplace. With respect to participation, our aim in articulating practices is to move away from a discussion of levels of participation and legitimacy within individual projects and towards an understanding of the organising, productive and reproductive work that is done in participating in the production of the built environment as part of an ongoing process of social change. They proliferate through multiple instances of performance and those who undertake them act as carriers of these practices, including forms of knowhow, understanding, motivational and emotional knowledge, creating resources through these acts of performance. The article contends that participatory practices are liable to be exploited re-presented or co-opted as commodified resources and this fragility limits the socially transformative potential of participation. Drawing on J.K Gibson-Graham's conception of 'diverse economies', an alternative representation is developed to recognize the landscape of practices constructing alternative economic systems, and exploring means and methods of resistance to co-option or enclosure.},

This phenomenon is referred to as the new international division in social reproductive work - outsourcing domestic chores to (mostly) migrants enables families in the global North to escape from the tensions arising from balancing productive and social reproductive work.

Findings - It attempts to analyze how the employment of Polish handymen or elderly care workers in Germany results from and recreates social inequalities based on gender, class and ethnicity/citizenship. Originality/value - For this purpose, it looks at both ends of this specific European care chain - the employing families in Germany as well as the migrant's families in Poland.

	abstract = {Purpose - This chapter explores ways in which urban women in China balance work and family demands, as the state's protective and welfare functions in post-Mao reform are increasingly being replaced by market forces, and the chapter examines how urban women's enactment of work and family roles are shaped by changing workplaces as well as by their personal and family circumstances. The purpose is to understand the impact of marketization on gender configuration through the lens of the work-family nexus. Research design - Data come from in-depth interviews conducted between 2005 and 2007 with 115 married women in four large cities. For analytical purposes, the informants were divided into three groups: stay-at-home moms, family-orientated working women, and work/career-oriented women. Findings - Although market reform may create opportunities for some women to enhance their personal lives, as a consequence of workers' loss of the safety net and welfare benefits, the neglect of women's reproductive work, and the commercialization of child care and child education, it has generated, for many women, much role conflict between work and family. Work/career-oriented women are able to actively engage in market activities precisely because they are protected still by the state, can afford commercial services of domestic tasks, or have strong support from their extended families. Originality/value - Women's varying role orientations reflect more their strategies of coping with structural changes than their mere adherence to certain gender ideologies. Social implications - The chapter calls for curbing unbridled market forces and restoring public services so as to create a family/womenfriendly work and social environment.

Through a qualitative focus on divisions of agrarian labor and decision-making, this article illustrates how the out-migration of men from rural areas of the Philippines is challenging preexisting gender ideologies of agricultural labor. The article examines how wives "left-behind" by their migrant husbands negotiate forms of farm work and responsibility that are culturally prescribed as "masculine." While a number of studies have detailed how femalemigration can destabilize conventional gender roles-as housebound husbands are shown to take up social reproductive work often considered "feminine"-the impacts of male migration on the participation of housebound wives in productive farming practices has been less studied. This article presents several vignettes of stay-at-home mothers who venture into farming and it analyzes how these women interpret their own gender identity. © 2011 BCAS, Inc.},

	abstract = {Children are increasingly recognised by geographers and other social scientists as independent actors who make valuable (albeit often overlooked) economic contributions to households and society. Hausa children in rural Northern Nigeria are highly mobile and play important economic roles supporting married women who spend much time in their walled residences (gida) because of the local socio-religious practice of Muslim seclusion. Secluded Hausa women have low mobility and do not attend local periodic markets, but make essential day-to-day purchases from child house-to-house hawkers while sending children on errands to make purchases on their behalf. This study shows how children work both independently and alongside adults in the spheres of agricultural production (on farms), domestic reproduction (in homesteads) and trade (within markets). The research reported documents the variety of children's work activities, predominantly through time use measurement, in order to examine aspects of the socio-spatial construction of childhood in a rural Northern Nigerian community. This is innovative on two counts. First, most earlier discussions of divisions of labour in Muslim Hausaland neglect both the work of children, and reproductive work. Second, even work that considers reproduction, or children's work, does not provide detailed time measurements of reproductive burdens. The paper examines divisions of children's labour and analyses how gender, space, age and other factors shape young people's experiences of rural life. The evidence presented here of children as competent agents making significant economic contributions in rural society challenges prevailing conceptions of children as mere dependent burdens on adult society. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Translated and updated from the seminal Spanish text on legal decisions affecting gender and sexuality in Latin America, this English edition is the only law text to focus specifically on the rights of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and the transgender population in addition to women’s rights more broadly. The volume provides close analysis of some of the most important decisions made by Latin American national courts, as well as those made by international legal bodies, that affect the rights and interests of these groups. Specially selected for their depth of argument and value as exemplars, the studies of good legal practice chart the path of the region’s normative values of justice as they have evolved away from a partial, and patriarchal, exercise of the law. They show how cases with vastly differing contexts such as, property rights and domestic violence have resulted in a mixed body of Latin American law. Some decisions are protective of women’s and minority rights. Some assess the wider social impacts of case law in which recognition of the discrete legal identities within households challenges established precepts, including religious ones. Other cases have been chosen as cautionary examples of bad decision-making and for the poverty of their legal debate. Updated to include the latest relevant jurisprudence from across the continent, this book is an informed, cohesive and comprehensive guide to understanding women’s and gender-based rights in Latin America. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

With the emergence of the internet and the proliferation of new media forms, narrative practices have evolved concurrently. An examination of the digitally mediated narratives I call e-stories, on mental health community websites can provide a window into how people use psychological concepts in narratives to do mental health work in everyday life (Edwards & Potter, 1992). This case study of the HealthyPlace online journal community shows how e-stories play a significant role in self-identity construction and ideological reproductive work in relation to mental illness and recovery. This research examines autobiographical introductions posted on twenty-eight journal homepages to explore how everyday people use psychotherapeutic coherence systems - lay versions of expert knowledge - to demonstrate expertise and authority while organizing experiences into a socially sharable narrative, characterizing self-identity in terms of illness and health simultaneously. These e-stories reveal the power of language to serve as a tool to negotiate community membership, reproduce ideologies about mental health and recovery, and employ narrative devices online to represent self-identities of people as "screwed up, but working on it." © John Benjamins Publishing Company.},

The text analyzes the relationships between the family life and professional life of women workers in the offshore at Campos Basin - RJ. To this end, 15 women who work in technical eminently masculine functions were interviewed. The results revealed the postponement of reflections on motherhood or planning to become pregnant after getting a job on land, difficulties in harmonizing family life and offshore work, and that these workers consider that work situation as a temporary way of life. The choices made by women workers at different personal and professional stages of life are oriented by values that are not static and that have been in constant debate and confrontation with the reality. Although most of the respondents were young, single and childless, there are some married women with children who "organize their lives according to boarding" and need a good infrastructure on land to continue in those functions.},

Through Foucault's argumentation on the production of subjectivities, this research analyzes the effects of the migration in the life of eight Brazilian women working in the Parisian reproductive sector. As the findings suggest, the migration can be characterized by a multifaceted set of experiences and elaborations that respond not only to oppressive and an exploitative regimes but also provide domestic workers, to some extent, with spaces of resistance which enable them to recreate their lives through migration in a freer way to deal with the respective processes of subjectification. On the one hand, Brazilian migrant domestic workers experience subordination and exploitation in their employment in Paris. Their status as illegal immigrants, lack of rights, informal labor contracts, restricted job opportunities, and unequal relationships between employer and employee contribute to their exploitation and subordination. On the other hand, despite their precarious situations, migrant domestic workers are able to reinvent themselves through a set of resistance strategies.},

	abstract = {Tito Mboweni's commitment to inflation targeting has met with support from those economists who believe that high interest rates would curb inflationary spending by individual spenders and would put limits on the inter-bank loans made by commercial banks. However, harsh criticism has emerged from various quarters, especially the labour movement that has argued that such austere inflation controls affect the majority of workers already suffering from high food and fuel costs that have impacted the world economy. Arguments also abound that inflation targets (IT) cannot control the cost of oil therefore price stability can never be assured. Within the South African context, a few feminist arguments have been voiced against interest rate controls as a tool to curb inflation, but these have not been widely articulated or publicised. This focus examines a feminist argument against interest rate driven inflation targeting. The argument engages some assumptions that ‘objective’ macroeconomic policies make about the ‘ungendered’ market and assesses how women more than men are affected by traditional fiscal and monetary policies due to the gendered nature of poverty and labour in our country and other developing countries. Finally, it proposes alternatives to curbing inflation that concentrate on employment generation in addition to IT. It also calls for the introduction of a gender-sensitive international economic and financial system that takes into account the differential effects of economic policies on men and women and calculates women's unpaid productive and reproductive work as a contribution to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). © 2008, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The analysis has been based on data from various Time-use Surveys (Women Institute 1993, 1996, 2001) as well as on data from different regional surveys: Andalusia, the Basque Country, Madrid and the metropolitan area of Barcelona. In the period 1993-2001, the amount of time devoted by men to housekeeping in Spain increased by 35% while women's time declined by 5%. Yet, in 2001 women's dedication to housekeeping was twice that of men's (7.2 vs 3.1 h daily). However, the imbalance in sharing of housework declined among younger people. Union formation and growing family size increase women's housework intensifying the uneven distribution of household chores. When women are employed and have higher educational and income levels, dedication to household tasks decreases and gender inequalities are reduced. In spite of growing male participation in housework, reproductive work is still mainly women's responsibility. The recent legal, social and cultural changes have not been able to eradicate the traditional model of assigning reproductive work in the home.},

This paper argues against compart-mentalising immigrant women's productive and reproductive work and calls for gender-sensitive approaches to migration that seek to understand women's migration in a more holistic way. The paper shows, on the one hand, how family, kinship and gender relations in the country of origin influence the migration of both Moroccan and Filipino women; on the other hand, it documents the different ways in which these relations change and get renegotiated through the migration process and in receiving countries. The empirical base of the research consists of 76 in-depth interviews, evenly divided between the cities and the two migrant nationalities, enabling multiple comparative perspectives to emerge. Use is also made of selected individual biographical accounts.},

	abstract = {Fisheries, particularly artisanal, have been subject of growing interest in the scientific community. More recently, the interest about the role of fishermen, their perceptions and rationalities in relation to natural resources and ecosystem services have been integrated into the scientific agendas. In this context, the place and the role of women in fisheries and environmental preservation are relatively invisible. This study aims to contribute to this visibility at the level of marine artisanal fisheries in the small community of Rio das Ostras (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). ). This study intends to know the artisanal fishermen community of Rio das Ostras, characterizing the division of local labour as much as to understand the perceptions that men and women of this community have on the relationship between women and small-scale fishing and how this context is valued and recognized. The research was conducted using qualitative methods, based on the Grounded Theory and the principles of Participatory Rapid Assessment. Primary data were collected through observation, interviews and participatory tools, and the sample was built using snowball and theoretical technics. The data were coded, categorized and triangulated. The analysis allows us to conclude that the role of women in the fishing community of Rio das Ostras, covers the implementation of multiple activities, based on sexual division of labor. Despite the extensive daily journey devoted to productive and reproductive work, such actions are recognized merely as a "help", although it significantly contributes to the family budget. This perspective undermines the visibility of women before the local community as well as the appreciation of their social role, as much as in the environmental preservation and sustainability as well as in the social and cultural changes in the local community.},

The hypothesis is that, in a labour market that is segmented by gender and migrant origin, individual characteristics (age, educational attainment), family characteristics (partnership, dependent children and partner's occupational status) and, specifically for immigrant women, the migratory strategy (who is the pioneer of the family migration, years from migrations) influence the female participation rates differently in accordance with the region of origin. Whilst the activity of native women is clearly explained by age and educational level, participation patterns of immigrant women are more determined by their family characteristics and their migratory histories. Moreover, results indicate a diverse range of immigrant participation patterns based on a women's region of birth. African women have a weak labour participation, very influenced by their family characteristics and by the length of the settlement from migration. Conversely, Latin American and non-EU women present higher participation rates than native women at all active age groups, independently of their educational attainment.},

	abstract = {The burgeoning literature on transnationalism involving skilled migrants - based largely on the view from the developed world - have generally paid little heed to "elite" women and the reproductive sphere. We argue that women play many roles in elite transnational migration streams and must be given full consideration as part of the "transnational elite." Attention is given to the way women - both "tied" and "lead" migrants - negotiate gendered identities as they participate in Singapore's regionalisation process, a state-driven initiative to extend the national economy by leveraging on growth in the region. Empirical material for the paper is mainly based on in-depth interviews with married women who were part of a larger project involving interviews with 150 Singaporeans who had lived, or were living, in China. In examining the movements through transnational space between Singapore and China, it is clear that patriarchal norms continue to shape women's understandings of their own identities vis-à-vis men's. Singapore women who move as accompanying spouses (the majority) find themselves giving up careers to focus on their domestic role in China (in the absence of access to "suitable" paid domestic service), and are not so much "deskilled" but "re-domesticated". The exceptional few women who ventured into China as entrepreneurs experienced considerable strain holding together geographically separate spheres of productive and reproductive work across the transnational terrain. Both sets of "stories" alert us to the need to include "elite" women - whether accompanying spouses or independent entrepreneurs - in our understanding of "transnational elites." This will contribute to the urgent task of ensuring that both productive and reproductive work are valorized in equal measure in conceptualizing transnationalism. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The main aim of the text is to argue that translocal female migrants paradoxically perceive their labour migration as a specific form of emancipation, despite the fact that they work in the socalled live-in-service jobs (where they live and work in private households) and often experience indignity. While in Austria they work in gendered and very demanding jobs with low wages, circular care migration provides them with the possibility to extend their gender power in the transforming Czech society. There is thus a paradox in that while they are marginalized in Austria, they are empowered on the Czech side of the border. This is achieved through paid reproductive work and better access to income, which leads to personal consumption based on their own interests and overall personal benefit. Special attention is paid to new forms of translocal care chains and new forms of these women's partner cohabitation (living apart together).},

	abstract = {Which factors fundamentally separate infectious disease from other types of predator-prey interactions studied by community ecologists? Could parasitism and predation be combined into a unifying model? After all, parasites and predators both convert energy and nutrients contained in their resources (hosts or prey, respectively) into new biomass and reproductive work. If these focal consumers perform similar roles, disease ecologists and community ecologists may essentially study the same problems. Therefore, they should use the same conceptual toolkits. Given this important potential for more intellectual crossfertilization, we contemplate these questions by way of two arguments. First, we consider the case that parasitism and predation are essentially the same types of interactions, varying only quantitatively. This line of argument highlights the many similar ways in which parasites and predators interact with their resources and other species at local and macroecological scales. Perhaps, then, major differences between predators and parasites vary only quantitatively, as a matter of body-size scaling. Parasites are typically much smaller than their host, while predators are similarly sized or exceed the size of their prey. The second case embraces eight (or more) qualitative splits that separate different types of predators from different types of parasites (developed by Lafferty and Kuris 2002). These axes differentiate consumers that eat one versus more than one resource individual per life stage, consumers that kill or do not kill their resources, and so forth. Both lines of argument eventually lead to the same challenge, however: Just how many qualitative models must one consider to capture the range from predation to parasitism in nature? The answer almost certainly depends on the focal question (implications for population dynamics, nutrient cycling, evolutionary change, etc.) and the currency used to evaluate it. © 2008 by Princeton University Press.

The research uses long-term participant observation in an inner-city public housing development, and in-depth interviews among 56 resident welfare mothers to explore these questions. The findings illustrate that some mothers are already working at full capacity, managing labor market and caregiving work in the midst of circumstances-including gang violence, serious health problems among individuals for whom they have undertaken responsibility, and illogical and punitive welfare systems-that are far beyond their control. © 1999 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

However, our review of the feminist literatures on globalization, development, and migration in the United States, the former Soviet Union, and South Asia suggests that discourses of empowered women and failed patriarchs are fused in the specter of the "reverse gender order." A presumption of this new order is that global capitalism has liberated women to such an extent that they have surpassed men who are now the truly "disadvantaged." Drawing on these literatures as evidence, we argue that the large-scale incorporation of poor and working-class women into global capitalism relies upon an ideology of the family that keeps women's labor "cheap" and draws support from the feminist idea that work is empowering for women. Diverse nationalisms uphold the ideology of the family as central to capitalist expansion, providing culturally resonant justifications for women's unpaid reproductive work, while men are breadwinners. Thus, poor and working-class men experience a painful dissonance between breadwinning expectations and economic opportunities. We show that these tensions between ideologies and material conditions make women's responsibility for reproductive work a structural feature of neoliberalism. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

They are usually performed in an enclosed, more or less private space, and they share problems in their temporal structuring. One difficulty for the temporality is its oscillation between autonomy and heteronomy, another problem is fragmentation, and the near impossibility of scheduling the internal processes of the work. What are the consequences if we look at the scholar as houseworker? Like the housewife the scholar has to face doubts about the productivity of his/her work, and questions about how he/she is actually spending her time. This means a feminization of scholarly work from which criticism of the traditional attitudes towards this type of work can be developed. Instead of believing that a well written article or a book is a piece of work with a status of its own in the world we can take into consideration that it might just as well not last longer than the neatly made bed. Ideas, after all, are volatile and in constant movement, and therefore in a permanent contradiction to the organisation of the academy - like housework and reproductive work are at odds with temporal economy. © 2007 Brill Academic Publishers.},

The analysis is carried out theoretically by asking whether human capital theory and Bourdieu's reproduction theory are adequate instruments for such an endeavour. It is argued that the explanatory power of the human capital concept of the interrelation between education and work is extremely weak, because the human capital concept conceals costs necessary to create human capital. In contrast, reproduction theory comprehends investments in education through reproductive work. But, reproduction theory fails short to explain ongoing gender hierarchies within employment. Therefore, analysis of social and societal structure needs to go beyond the focus on education and work to explain the maintenance of gender hierarchies. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Retrospective chart review and follow-up (Canadian Task Force classification 11-2). Setting. Academic-affiliated, private reproductive endocrinology practice. Patients. One hundred infertile women. Intervention. Diagnostic and/or therapeutic laparoscopy. Measurements and Main Results. Of 100 patients with a negative reproductive work-up up to the point of laparoscopy, 68 had pathology of reproductive significance: intrinsic tubal disease 24, peritubal adhesive disease 34, and endometriosis 43, some in combination. Laparoscopy was especially helpful in establishing treatment protocols for older women, who were referred for assisted reproductive techniques earlier than otherwise might have been the case. Women conceived after hormone therapy and after operative intervention. Although the hysterosalpingogram was read as normal in all women, tubal disease was diagnosed laparoscopically, independent of endometriosis, in 27 patients, with 2 having complete obstruction. Endometriosis stage I-II was found in 22 patients, stage III in 13, and stage IV in 6. Conclusion. Even in women thought to be at low risk for significant pelvic pathology affecting reproduction, the yield was high. Although some pregnancies were achieved after operative intervention, frequently laparoscopy was helpful in making a decision to go to assisted reproductive technology, particularly when infertility had been of long duration and in older women. Frequently the degree of pathology was such that a full operating suite was necessary to provide adequate instrumentation and anesthesia for operative intervention, which would not have been the case with office laparoscopy.},

	abstract = {The World Bank Report 2012 starts with this statement: “Gender equality matters in itself and it matters for development because, in today’s globalized worlds, countries that use the skills and talents of their women would have an advantage over those which do not use it.” With the frame that suggest that gender equality matters, this paper describes some policy alternatives oriented to overcome gender disadvantages in the formal labor market incorporation of the urban middle class women in Colombia. On balance, the final recommendation suggest that it is desirable to adopt policy alternatives as Community Centers, which are programs oriented to a social redistribution of the domestic work as a way to encourage women participation in the formal labor market with the social support of the members of their own community.; The problem that the social policy needs to address is the segregation of women in the formal labor market in Colombia. Although the evidence shows that the women overcome the educational gap by showing better performance in education that their male peers, women are still segregated of the labor market. The persistence of high rates of unemployment on the female population, the prevalence of the informal labor market as a women labor market, and the presence of the payment difference between men and women with similar professional trainings are circumstances that sustain the segregation statement. These circumstances are inefficient for the society because an economic analysis shows that the cost of maintain the statu quo is externalized in the social security system that includes health, pension and maternity leave regimens. Therefore, the women segregation involves a market failure.; This paper evaluates five policy alternatives each directed to the progress of a different causal dimension of the problem: (i) Quotas in the private market, (ii) Flexible working hours, (iii) replace the maternity leave with a family leave, (iv) Increase the Community Centers for redistributing the care work, and (v) Equal payment enforcement. The first alternative looks to increase women’s participation in the formal labor market. The second, third, and fourth alternatives constitute a package addressed at redistributing care work by reducing women’s responsibility for reproductive work in the household with the help of husbands and the local government. The fifth alternative intervenes to resolve the equal payment problem.; After a four criteria evaluation that measure effectiveness, robustness and improbability in implementation, efficiency and political acceptability or social opposition, the strongest alternative is the fostering of Community Centers that promote a redistribution of care work. This policy performs well in the assessment process because it combines gender focus with important indirect effects: child support and human capabilities. The policy also shows a bottom up implementation process that overcomes the main adoption difficulties in the gender focus programs and is supported by strong evidence of success in the Colombian context; this evidence is produced by both transnational actors as a World Bank and also in local accountability reporters executed by local institutions like Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF). © Revista de Economía del Rosario.

Based on twenty-four months of research, which included life history interviews and survey responses obtained at three sites of factory production in Thailand, the study charts the complexities of Burmese migrant workers' transborder care strategies, as they manage their responsibilities to their children and natal families.

	abstract = {Reproductive ageing is a contextual process that is made meaningful through cultural construction (notions of the body, morality and appropriate reproductive behaviour) and gendered experience (of individual women and men to physiological change and in terms of the social expectations that accompany them). It cannot be de-contextualised. The relevance of a cultural and anthropological perspective is that it focuses on the lived experience of ageing and the associated diverse meanings that inform people’s health-seeking behaviour in response to it. It is ethnographic in the sense of being characterised as the first-hand study of a specific community, not necessarily located in the same place. The focus is on obtaining diverse local perceptions through the intense engagement of the researcher in the life worlds of members of the community. The ethnographic example is the basis upon which theoretical and comparative generalisations are then made. An ethnographic perspective on the ways in which ageing is conceptualised, experienced and acted upon is important as it facilitates an emic (actor-centred) and interpretive understanding beyond the insights provided by statistics and data on prevalence. Such an analysis is critical in the sense that it is able to provide explanations as to why the statistics are as they are. Cultural studies on reproduction and ageing tend to focus on three key issues: The body and diverse meanings attributed to bodily processes (how does procreation take place, who ‘owns’ the body) morality/religion (what is appropriate reproductive behaviour) social hierarchy/power (who has more reproductive work, responsibility and entitlement). © 2009 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.},

	abstract = {Domestic labour - in both historical and current times - has been undervalued as women's work and as nonwork. Both paid domestic work and its unpaid equivalent demonstrate structural continuities across public and private spheres, revealing intersectionalities of gender, race or ethnicity, age, class, language, nationality, and immigration or citizenship status. The position of paid domestic labour on the boundary of home and work means that it is often not recognised as 'real' labour, leading to the marginalisation and exploitation of those who perform such work. With the globalisation of labour markets in the late twentieth century, the shift of reproductive work from the household to the market has intensified. This shift has been fuelled, on the one hand, by the increasing demand for transnational domestic workers, who show flexibility in adjusting to new globalised settings. On the other hand, workers from less developed countries are ready to enter domestic employment abroad as contract workers under precarious conditions. In the context of the home, employer-worker relations are often embedded in asymmetrical power relations, giving rise to a politics of home space rooted in the management and negotiation of differences. At the international level, the creation of global care chains might imply that resolving the care crisis in the host society could lead to a care deficit in the home country. Global connectivity has also facilitated transnational alliances among contract domestic workers, thereby holding out the possibility of creating new political spaces in the future. © 2012 Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..},

Methodologically, the paper is based on the discursive analysis of the written records of the debates held in the Congress on these legal initiatives, complemented with semi-structured interviews with MP's and government officials. From this analysis it is possible to conclude that, despite important advancements, women's citizenship is still represented as contributing to society mainly through care and, more recently, through their contribution towards overcoming poverty.},

It argues that social change can be understood, culturally, as involving a process of de-institutionalisation and, structurally, as involving differentiation within elementary family groups as well as within extended family networks. Family change is set in the context of changes in the housing and labour markets and the demographic, industrial and occupational changes of the past 40 years. These changes are associated with increases in women's economic activity rates and a decrease in their 'degree of domesticity'. They are also associated with increasing differentiation within families such that occupational heterogeneity is now found at the heart of the elementary family as well as within kinship groupings as was the case 40 years ago. Thus the trend towards increased differentiation identified in the original study (Rosser and Harris: The Family and Social Change) has continued into the 21st century. This is associated with a de-institutionalisation of family life and an increasing need for partners to negotiate participation in both productive and reproductive work.},

Rather than extend Gramsci's investment in virtuosic, masterful performances of gesture, this article considers the potentiality of gesture through Lucille Ball's and Tehching Hsieh's performances of bad timing. As different as these performances are in terms of genre and historical situation, each uses gesture as a technique to performatively divide the labor process, producing fleeting temporalities of waste within rhythms marshaled toward production and accumulation. While it tracks the effects of these itinerant gestures, this article reconsiders the oppositions between productive and reproductive work, rationality and emotionality, and work and home that sustain Gramsci's theory, as well as how the collapse of such oppositions introduces alternative historical and artistic trajectories into theories of precariousness. © 2013 © 2013 Women & Performance Project Inc.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of overweight and obesity and the association with demographic, reproductive work variables in a representative cohort of working nurses and midwives. Design: A cross sectional study of self reported survey data. Settings: Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Methods: Measurement outcomes included BMI categories, demographic (age, gender, marital status, ethnicity), reproductive (parity, number of births, mother's age at first birth, birth type and menopausal status) and workforce (registration council, employment type and principal specialty) variables. Participants: 4996 respondents to the Nurses and Midwives e-Cohort study who were currently registered and working in nursing or midwifery in Australia (. n=. 3144), New Zealand (. n=. 778) or the United Kingdom (. n=. 1074). Results: Amongst the sample 61.87% were outside the healthy weight range and across all three jurisdictions the prevalence of obesity in nurses and midwives exceeded rates in the source populations by 1.73% up to 3.74%. Being overweight or obese was significantly associated with increasing age (35-44 yrs aOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.41-2.08; 45-55 yrs aOR 1.90, 95%CI 1.56-2.31; 55-64 aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.71-2.88), and male gender (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.15-1.87). Primiparous nurses and midwives were more likely to be overweight or obese (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.06-1.76) as were those who had reached menopause (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.69). Nurses and midwives in part-time or casual employment had significantly reduced risk of being overweight or obese, (aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94 and aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96 respectively), whilst working in aged carried increased risk (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.04-1.80). Conclusion: Nurses and midwives in this study have higher prevalence of obesity and overweight than the general population and those who are older, male, or female primiparous and menopausal have significantly higher risk of overweight or obesity as do those working fulltime, or in aged care.

To this end, an anthropological study was made using an ethnography-based qualitative approach. Between 2010 and 2012, a total of 31 in-depth interviews were conducted. Te main results reveal that the fact that women are well represented in the Cuban job market, their good training, and their ability to develop strategies to cope with adverse situations are all elements of considerable importance. In turn, it is pointed out that current Cuban migratory regulations, to a certain extent, cause Cubans to plan their migration with no return in mind; this often distances them from job sectors involving reproductive work. © 2015, El Colegio de la Frontiera Norte.

In the UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore and most of Western Europe, oocytes are made available through modestly reimbursed donation, and, owing to the onerous nature of donation, the existing demand for reproductive oocytes far outstrips availability. SCNT research will place this system under even greater pressure. This paper investigates the growth in a global market for oocytes, where transnational IVF clinics broker sales between generally poor, female vendors and wealthy purchasers, beyond the borders of national regulation, and with little in the way of clinical or bioethical scrutiny. It considers the possible impact that SCNT research will have on this global market. It argues that oocyte vending could be understood as a kind of reproductive labor in the bioeconomy, and suggests some ways to improve the protection, security and power of vendors. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.},

Indeed, this technology does not challenge, but rather consolidates, the construction of female identities based on motherhood. While the use of medical contraceptives allows women to conciliate with greater ease professional activity and motherhood, this practice does not question the sexual division of productive and reproductive work, which remains an important component of social order. An analysis of practices and representations in the sphere of sexuality reveals the persistancy of a gender divide.},

Using the tools of critical discourse analysis, I present a contrasting comparison of the 'good mother' construct in the two postsocialist societies in question: a 'choosing mother manager' in Bulgaria and a 'mother-domestic-angel' in Hungary.

	abstract = {Animals held in the unnatural surroundings of the laboratory sometimes may exhibit unusual behavior, making experimental results difficult to interpret unless the natural history of the species is well understood. Some well-studied species, such as the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis, which usually seem to adapt well to captivity, are therefore commonly used in laboratory experiments and assumed to function normally. However, this assumption may sometimes be unfounded. In this study, captive gravid T. sirtalis showed reduced feeding behavior, similar to free-ranging gravid snakes from the same population but showed very different thermoregulatory behavior, choosing low temperatures instead of high. By contrast, gravid congeners, Thamnophis elegans, showed similar feeding and thermoregulatory behavior in captivity and in the field. Choice of lower temperature by gravid T. sirtalis apparently led to extended periods of parturition for individual females and a high incidence of dead young in litters. Other studies of T. sirtalis in captivity also have yielded fairly high proportions of dead offspring, suggesting that (1) this species has a relatively high background rate of natural stillbirth; and/or (2) it is not always as suitable a species for behavioral/reproductive work in the laboratory as it seems to be. Whether or not the first proposition is true, I conclude that T. sirtalis in this study behaved differently from snakes in the field, exacerbating the rate of stillbirth. Thus, laboratory studies of behavior will be most fruitful if informed by field studies.},

	abstract = {Studies have shown that some sociodemographic factors, such as marital status, employment status or social class, can affect mental health in different ways for each gender. However, up until now, few research projects have tried to ascertain if the role that reproductive work or psychosocial factors play in mental health is different for men and women. The aim of this study is to assess the differences between men and women in terms of how reproductive work, sociodemographic and psychosocial factors are linked to psychological distress in Spain. A cross-sectional study of 29,478 male and female adults using data gathered for the Spanish National Health Survey 2006 was carried out. Psychological distress was measured using the GHQ-12. The independent variables analyzed were: sociodemographic, psychosocial (family functionality and functional social support) and those related to reproductive work (living with or being in charge of different types of people needing care and number of hours devoted to caregiver tasks). Different independent logistic regression models were developed for men and women. In general, with the exception of men who were more prone to psychological distress if they were signed off work for 3 months or more, no major differences were observed regarding the effect of sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics on psychological distress. With regard to reproductive work, the likelihood of psychological distress doubles in both sexes when the person lives with someone who needs care. In women, a greater number of hours devoted to caring for another person is associated with an increase in distress. Men play a less frequent role in caregiving, but the impact on psychological distress is similar to that in women. Women experienced more psychological distress when they had to live with or be in charge of a disabled person or different types of persons needing care, while men were not affected by this. Major differences have been identified in terms of psychological distress in women and men in several aspects of reproductive work to date unexplored. © 2011 Society for Prevention Research.},

Significant maternal and child health costs result from children's premature weaning onto formula or solid food. While human milk production meets the standard national accounting criteria for inclusion in GDP, current practice is to ignore its significant economic value and the substantial private and public health costs of commercial breastmilk substitutes. Economic output measures such as GDP thus are incomplete and biased estimates of national food production and overall economic output, and they distort policy priorities to the disadvantage of women and children. © 2005 IAFFE.},

To explore differences related to health and working conditions by comparing socio-demographic parameters, reproductive and prenatal care characteristics and working conditions among pregnant women who are employed outside the home (extra-domestic) while still performing a domestic workload versus those who perform exclusively domestic work in the home (intra-domestic). Methods. A cross-sectional study was carried out at Family Medicine Unit N 31 of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) in Mexico City between April and July 2003. Interviews were conducted with 537 pregnant women engaged in either extra-domestic work plus intra-domestic tasks, or those performing strictly intra-domestic work. Information was obtained regarding their demographic status, prenatal care, reproductive, work characteristics, and health during pregnancy. Results. One hundred ninety-six (36.5%) of the interviewed women had paid jobs outside the home in addition to domestic tasks, while three hundred forty-one (63.5 %) engaged in exclusively intra-domestic occupations. Of the women with paid jobs, 78.6% worked as clerks. Among domestic tasks, we found that the greatest workload was associated with washing of clothes, and our micro-ergonomic analysis revealed that women who worked strictly inside the home had a higher domestic workload versus employed women (69.2 vs. 44.9%). When we analyzed the effect of work on health during pregnancy, we observed that women who worked strictly inside the home were at a higher risk for musculoskeletal and genitourinary symptoms than those employed outside the home. Conclusion. These findings suggest that the effect of intra-domestic work should not be ignored when considering women's health during pregnancy, and that greater attention should be paid to women's working conditions during intra and extra-domestic work. © 2007 Torres-Arreola et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In order to better contextualize the ethnographic context, the chapter draws upon Mies’ concept of housewifization’ to sketch the sexual division of labor and address the historical tension between productive and reproductive work under global capitalism. In addition to redressing limited state funded social services, the availability of feminized migrant care labor represents one of the ways in which capital accumulation is facilitated by and for the benefit of both individual employers and the state. © 2014 Mary romero, Valerie Preston, Wenona Giles and the contributors.},

	abstract = {Traditional transport planning has tended to focus on addressing the needs of mainstream commuters through the provision of improved transport infrastructure and services, leaving out a significant number of existing and prospective users especially rural and peri-urban dwellers. However, in recent years there has been a relatively strong consensus to move towards addressing all travel needs. These travel needs include those relating to servicing social and reproductive work, as well as informal productive work - the types of activities that tend to be performed by women, yet are seldom sufficiently recognised or valued for the function they perform in sustaining households and communities (Mashiri, 1997). For development to be sustainable and equitable, gender needs to be mainstreamed into transport research and implementation initiatives. This is important for the design and implementation of transport systems that are responsive to the practical needs of women, households' and indeed communities. Mainstreaming gender is also necessary for the empowerment of women, particularly the poor, by addressing their strategic needs, such as access to socio-economic opportunities. This paper provides an overview of available literature with respect to gender and transport, highlights some information gaps and proposes areas for further research and action.},

To this end, 15 women who work in technical eminently masculine functions were interviewed. The results revealed the postponement of reflections on motherhood or planning to become pregnant after getting a job on land, difficulties in harmonizing family life and offshore work, and that these workers consider that work situation as a temporary way of life. The choices made by women workers at different personal and professional stages of life are oriented by values that are not static and that have been in constant debate and confrontation with the reality. Although most of the respondents were young, single and childless, there are some married women with children who "organize their lives according to boarding" and need a good infrastructure on land to continue in those functions.},

	abstract = {Domestic labour - in both historical and current times - has been undervalued as women’s work and as nonwork. Both paid domestic work and its unpaid equivalent demonstrate structural continuities across public and private spheres, revealing intersectionalities of gender, race or ethnicity, age, class, language, nationality, and immigration or citizenship status. The position of paid domestic labour on the boundary of home and work means that it is often not recognised as ‘real’ labour, leading to the marginalisation and exploitation of those who perform such work. With the globalisation of labour markets in the late twentieth century, the shift of reproductive work from the household to the market has intensified. This shift has been fuelled, on the one hand, by the increasing demand for transnational domestic workers, who show flexibility in adjusting to new globalised settings. On the other hand, workers from less developed countries are ready to enter domestic employment abroad as contract workers under precarious conditions. In the context of the home, employer-worker relations are often embedded in asymmetrical power relations, giving rise to a politics of home space rooted in the management and negotiation of differences. At the international level, the creation of global care chains might imply that resolving the care crisis in the host society could lead to a care deficit in the home country. Global connectivity has also facilitated transnational alliances among contract domestic workers, thereby holding out the possibility of creating new political spaces in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Female labor force participation is related to competing uses for women's time, especially in a context of poor infrastructure and limited availability of purchased replacements for household labor. We examine factors affecting women's participation in employment and reproductive household work in Tajikistan, drawing on the 2003 Tajikistan Living Standards Survey. We incorporate specific conditions in Central Asia, including the prevalence of extended family households, norms about how women share household work, an absence of market substitutes for caring and reproductive labor, employment in family enterprises and poor infrastructure, especially in rural areas. We estimate the system using a Generalized Maximum Entropy (GME) approach. We find that few individual and household characteristics are related to time in employment. Time in noncare reproductive work decreases if a woman receives direct remuneration for her employment (compared to working in a family farm or enterprise but receiving no direct remuneration), but increases if the woman has less access to infrastructure. Rural women spend more time in both employment and non-care reproductive work than urban women, but less time in care work. Lack of infrastructure may leave women with few choices with respect to non-care reproductive work, while overall levels of time poverty create pressures on care time. © 2013 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.},

Considering that 'non employment' refers to which category of citizens is considered as legitimately non-employed and to what are the gender implications of these assumptions, we ask the following questions: which are the 'hottest' issues in Italian policy debates in the area of 'non employment'? How gendered are debates? What categories of subjects do the debates construct? In discussing Italian policy debates on reconciliation, domestic work, and pensions, we argue that Italian non-employment policies construct specific subjects by reproducing traditional gender stereotypes concerning the division of productive and reproductive work, and by politically articulating the intersection of gender and class, ethnicity, and age which contributes to further disadvantages for women.

Social Role Theory explains this difference taking into account socialization processes which provide men and women with different roles. In this chapter, data from the International Social Survey Program enrolling 35 nations (N = 46.638) were used in order to analyze the attitude differences toward female productive work (FPW) between sexes and between countries. In particular, countries have been arranged according to the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), Gender Development Index (GDI) and ratio between working women and working men (F/M Ratio). These measures give an index of gender equality/inequality of each country. Moreover, Gross Domestic Product at a Purchasing Power Parity (GDP PPP) is considered as a control variable. We used a correlational, meta-analytical procedure in order to test gender difference across countries and meta-regression to assess the not-independent effect of the various national indexes (GEM, GDI, F/M Ratio and GDP). Results were very supportive for Social Role Theory and they showed that a) across countries, men were less favorable toward FPW than women, b) FPW attitude became more positive as general national equality increased, and c) nearly paradoxically, gender difference in FPW attitude increased as countries became more equalitarian with respect to gender. The last section of the chapter is devoted to the discussion of results and their theoretical and practical implications. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The role of rural women in eradicating poverty and ending hunger has been recognised by both scholars and practitioners. There is an acknowledgement that women serve a critical role in the agricultural labour force, subsistence farming, and rural development in sub-Saharan Africa, yet their central role in food security has been largely ignored, particularly in policy (Govender, 2012). Although much of the labour of rural women is not nationally defined as economically active employment these women still spend long hours in undervalued productive and reproductive work to ensure the well-being of their households. Linked to this role is the challenge of dealing with rapidly changing climatic conditions. Women assume primary responsibility in fetching water and wood for meal preparation, and in tilling the ground. They are among the most vulnerable groups to climate change as a result of their precarious environmental livelihoods. Using data from a workshop with rural women to discuss climate change and qualitative interviews with rural women in selected rural communities in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal we explore the meaning of climate change. We report on the way climate change is understood, its effects on rural livelihoods and some responses to climate change problems experienced by the women in the communities. The women in the rural communities highlight that there are also social problems that have arisen from water scarcity. As a result of the household division of labour, rural girls confront particular challenges as they need to search further from home for water and are exposed to the risk of gender violence. © 2014 T.

	abstract = {Recent social and economic changes focused attention first on promoting women's employment, and now on reversing declining fertility. Preference theory helps us to understand women's choices between paid jobs and family work, and provides an empirical basis for social and family policy. It predicts continuing sex differences in lifestyle and life goals, and increasing diversity in life patterns for men and women. In contrast, feminism insists that all sex differences can and should be eliminated, so that diversity will vanish. Social scientists are now giving more attention, and weight, to (unpaid) reproductive work and household work, bringing them into the policy limelight. Policy-makers are also confirming the economic and social importance of population growth, and hence the necessity for active population policies. Judging by results, the two policies that appear to have the greatest potential for encouraging women to achieve their ideal family size are raising family allowances to reduce the cost of children, and the homecare allowance which pays one parent a salary for full-time childcare. Both have proved successful and effective in Europe. Overall, social policy must recognise female diversity, and support it with diversified policies that support all groups of women. To date, careerist women have been given greater support than family-centred women who tend to have the largest families. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Over the last four decades, research hasmoved from the discovery of immigration, initially conceptualised largely as a story of male workers, to a discovery of female migrants. Consideration of their productive and reproductive work and closer attention to the gender composition of migration streams have become increasingly important aspects of migration studies. Using as examples the United States and France, two major historical sites of labour immigration, I aim to ask questions of both the history and the historiography. The changing epistemologies of gender studies today can bring yet new questions and answers to the field, notably about who came, how men and women immigrants have been perceived by state, society and historians. But the gender question also means, importantly, asking about the before and after of migration. How have gender regimes in the countries of origin affected emigration and how has immigration affected gender relations? Chapters © 2013 The Authors.

The production bias of fisheries management programs has not only largely overlooked the role of fisherwomen, but also marginalized "fish mammies" in terms of resources and training. This study draws on three in-country fisheries surveys, as well as interviews and focus groups, and employs a gender-aware sustainable livelihood framework to make visible the economic space occupied by women in Sierra Leone's small-scale fisheries. The study highlights how women's variegated access to capital and resources interacts with social norms and reproductive work and argues for more social and economic investment in women's fish processing and reproductive work enabling them to reconcile both roles more effectively. © 2014 IAFFE.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade the Republic of Cyprus has become the destination of an increasing number of migrants from Third World countries and eastern Europe; many of whom are women who earn their living as sex workers or housemaids. The feminisation of labour migration to Cyprus is related to the increasing integration of native women in the national labour market, whereas the gendered ascription of domestic work has not changed. In view of the emergence of new inequalities with­ in the gendered group of women, this paper will look at different notions of gender equality expressed by Greek-Cypriot women who take an active role in politics. It argues that even though many of the women interviewed endeavour to establish gender equality, the androcentric evaluation of gainful labour versus unpaid or at best lowly paid reproductive work, and hence gender inequality, is reproduced on a racialised level. © 2001, University of Nicosia.

This article focuses on the nature of women's work and family structure in upper‐ middle‐class families, which most urban studies of developing countries have ignored. It contrasts existing models of female labor‐force participation with the voices of upper‐middle‐class housewives who engage in various labor activities to enhance the social status of the family. The article argues that the "economic miracle" of South Korea is closely related to the patriarchal family ideology of upper–middle–class families, and that families function as "shock absorbers" in the rapid advance of late‐industrial capitalism. Not only men's productive work, but also women's reproductive work, is highly valued, by the state and by the society in general, for its contribution to rapid economic development. Late industrialization is a complex process that provides both liberating and oppressive contexts for gender practices and creates contradictory interpretations of gender roles.

	abstract = {Over the last decade, a significant body of feminist research has developed which has home-based reproduction as its focus. Strategically placed at the interface of sociology and social policy, this literature has had a significant impact on wider debates about everyday social reproduction. Yet, it has remained largely uncritiqued. Recognising the lack of critical debate, the paper reviews the way in which the concept of caring has been theorised within British feminist research. It suggests that caring has been typically defined by feminist researchers as the unpaid work of kin within the private domain of their family. Gender is seen as the dominant system of social relations which shapes the organisation of such care. Thus, rather than a broad structural analysis of everyday reproduction within families, most feminist research on caring has been restricted to one form of care (unpaid care by relatives) and one structural division (gender). The way in which racial and class divisions are embedded in everyday reproductive work has been largely eclipsed. Drawing on the critiques of Black women writers, the paper highlights forms of, and divisions within, home-based reproduction obscured in past and present feminist research on caring. It takes domestic service as a case-study which highlights how the social divisions of `race’ and class, as well as gender, have been constituted through women's experiences of looking after families. © 1991, British Sociological Association Publications Limited.

These villages are part of a 20-year old colonisation project. The geographical origins of the migrants in temperate latitudes of the Andean region provide guidelines on the role of these women before migration. These source regions are characterised by a very high level of female involvement in agricultural activities and exceptionally outstanding female participation in cattle raising. This cultural heritage in the definition of male and female roles has facilitated peasant women's insertion in the exacting task of colonising. Colonisation has also had its own impact on women's participation. -from Author},

	abstract = {The term rural gentrification is examined and contrasted with contemporary debates over urban gentrification. A common root, in the displacement of a working-class populace by middle-class incomers, is identified and also criticised. Attention is drawn to debates current within urban studies concerning the definition of gentrification as a process of capital investment or as a means to purchase particular lifestyles, the role of reproductive work and service provision, and the possibility of diverse types of gentrifiers and processes of gentrification. The paper investigates, through a substantive study of households in four villages in Gower, whether some of these arguments can illuminate understandings of rural gentrification. Claims that gentrification is necessarily associated with home owners acting as capitalist developers or with an emergent service class are questioned and the possibility of 'marginal gentrifiers' is raised. It is also suggested that asymmetries in class positions of householders may be constitutive of rural gentrification. Finally it is argued that comparative work should be undertaken to draw out both the commonalities and differences between rural and urban gentrification and also within gentrification in various rural localities. © 1993.},

When one looks at the productive and reproductive work undertaken by farm women it is clear that they are heavily involved in the ‘men's work’ undertaken in their enterprise. Consequently, their antagonism to feminism is difficult to understand. However, when issues of feminist theorising are addressed, it becomes clear that, in fact, feminism may have alienated many farm women. By using the concepts of patriarchy and power to illuminate farm women's lives, it is clear that they are extremely marginalised and their labour contributions are largely ignored.

Although ‘embedded’ families, and especially the extended family focused around ‘strong’ mothers, are assumed to be characteristic of Northern Ireland, very little study of the family has occurred. In this analysis of the available material, it is argued that although extended families and high levels of physical, material, and emotional reproductive work among women are characteristic features of Northern Ireland, this does not mean that women in Northern Ireland experience the family as a site of power. The interaction of external and internal household relations limit the extent to which women's influence in families can be converted into power. The subordination of influence to power occurs through the limits imposed by, on the one hand, the importance of attained family status (and within that tensions around ‘respectability’) in a relatively closed society, and, on the other, low levels of economic and political resources among women. © 1993, Pergamon Press Ltd..

	abstract = {Global economic restructuring has not only intensified the shift in reproductive work from the household to the market, but it has been predicated on the international mobility of labour to countries where locals are no longer willing to work in low-paying menial jobs. This paper focuses on Singapore as a country which has drawn upon female migrant workers from neighbouring developing countries to work as domestic helpers in Singapore such that the gainful entry of its own women into the formal economy has been facilitated. Drawing upon a range of secondary sources as well as field data, the paper demonstrates how state policies on labour migration in Singapore have played a crucial role in influencing the uneven employer-employee relationships that migrant female domestic helpers in Singapore households find themselves in. More generally, it argues that the availability of foreign domestic helpers in Singapore and the state discourse on the issue has contributed to perpetuating the patriarchal ideology of housework as women's work and of housework as non-work.

	abstract = {A gender perspective requires examining how gender roles affect the ways in which various family members can participate in the wider community, economy, and state. It is important to recognize the disparity between perceptions about the family as a benign institution and the reality that many families consist of a paradoxical blend of love, support, friction, domination, and even cruelty. Definitions of family reveal the social implications of the belief that families are centered on children and the need of patriarchs to control female sexuality. Notions about households are generally more concrete, and many households include people who are not family members and are not nuclear in nature. Many development initiatives have floundered because of the assumption that households distribute resources according to individual needs. Instead, household members use bargaining power to get their way, and women are generally in weaker bargaining positions than men. Linking men solely with production and women solely with reproduction ignores the realities of most women's lives, although the unpaid reproductive work women do influences their access to paid employment. In order to assure family stability and to find ways to provide social welfare, women's workload in the family must be reduced. Family life must not be hidden in a "private" sphere where injustices and violence are ignored. Unconscious biases against families of various types must be rooted out and overcome, and policy-makers must recognize that families evolve to meet changing needs. Finally, the notion of the nuclear family as the ideal family type must be challenged.},

Gender roles and identities lock women into leisure which is experienced mostly within the confines of the home. The lack of material resources also limits their ability to undertake a wider range, as well as a greater number, of leisure activities within the public sphere outside the home. These conditions become emphasised in the more mature years of a woman's life, such that leisure expectations that are assumed for the Third Age seldom materialise. In the study of older women in Singapore, it was found that many engaged in home-bound activities and where these extended into public spaces, the activities conformed to gender and age expectations and according to material resources. The paper argues that leisure, especially for older women, must be contextualised; it requires an understanding of how social ideologies construct gender and age identities and roles, and therefore shape the leisure outcomes and spaces in which they are carried out. © 1997 Cambridge University Press.},

The authors examine whether women's labor force participation in the formal sector responds to improving opportunities for women, declining opportunities for men, or the household's changing opportunity structures. Specifically, they examine a woman's return to work after the birth of her first child as the initial point of conflict between productive and reproductive work. The data used in these analyses are from the 1982 Puerto Rican Fertility and Family Planning Assessment (PRFFPA), an islandwide, representative sample of never-married and ever-married women between the ages of fifteen and forty-nine. The authors estimate a series of nested logistic regression models to evaluate the influence of occupational expansion or contraction on the timing of return to work after the first birth. Their findings offer selective support for the idea that women's lives are affected primarily by the occurrence of growing labor demand for women's labor. © 1994, SAGE Periodicals Press.

	abstract = {An important form of migration in a number of Latin American countries involves movement to pioneer zones in the forests on the frontiers of settlement. In contrast to urban migration, rural-to-rural migration to new land settlements often means that women lose rights in land, lose direct income, face increasing workloads, particularly in reproduction as education and health services are poorer, and suffer painful social isolation. I have conducted research in three contrasting small pioneer areas in Colombia. I shall first describe the nature of these areas, then examine the gender division of productive and reproductive work within them, looking at males and females of different ages via a cross-sectional analysis. I shall then provide case studies of selected households, showing how experiences have varied over the life course. These case studies provide an opportunity to explore differences between an individual's life path and the collective patterns revealed by the cross-sectional material. Through these analyses, I hope to reveal some of the ways in which women's lives are shaped by both their context and their life course, and to examine the choices people make as they deal with the contraints and opportunities of living in these pioneer settlements. -from Author},
